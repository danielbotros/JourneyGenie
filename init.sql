They’ve been called “monkey dogs” and “ape terriers.” The French say diablotin moustachu (“mustached little devil”), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. “This isn’t a breed you train,” a professional dog handler tells us, “He’s like a human. You befriend him.” The dense, harsh coat is described as “neat but shaggy” and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs. The Affenpinscher: loyal, curious, and famously amusing; this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it’s the Affenpinscher’s apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.','Confident, Famously Funny, Fearless','148','22.86','29.21','3.17514659','4.535923700000001',12.0,15.0,'Toy Group',0.6,'2-3 Times a Week Brushing',0.6,'Seasonal',0.6,'Regular Exercise',0.8,'Easy Training',1.0,'Outgoing');

The Afghan Hound is an athlete capable of immense speed and requires a large fenced in yard and exercise daily.Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed’s crowning glory isn’t just for show — it served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans originally earned their keep.

Their huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland’s punishing terrain.The Afghan Hound is a special breed for special people. A breed expert writes, “It’s not the breed for all would-be dog owners, but where the dog and owner combination is right, no animal can equal the Afghan Hound as a pet.” The Afghan Hound is an aloof and dignified aristocrat of sublime beauty.

In different parts of the South he was known as the White English Southern Bulldog, but most commonly just “bulldog.” The breed was not called a bulldog because of a certain look, but because they did real bulldog work.

Built more for endurance than speed, the Basset moves in a deliberate but effortless manner. The breed’s scenting ability is uncanny; it’s said that among dogs only the Bloodhound’s nose is more accurate. Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks in a loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections, they are steadfastly loyal.

The Beagle’s fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a broad head.A breed described as “merry” by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable—all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime.

Well-socialized Beardies will get on nicely with other animals and kids. They bore easily, and training must be kept interesting.

The breed has maintained versatility from the beginning and are highly intelligent and adaptable. As such, training must be kept lively and interesting.

Although it is not a widely known breed, the Dutch Shepherd is a loyal companion and competent working dog used for obedience, dog sports, herding, tracking, search and rescue, and as a police dog. The Dutch Shepherd is a lively, athletic, alert and intelligent breed, and has retained its herding instinct for which it was originally developed. Having an independent nature, it can be slightly obstinate and have a mind of its own. Since its original duties were to keep flocks of sheep in a particular location, it is able to run all day, and that is reflected in its physique and structure.','Intelligent, Lively, Athletic',NULL,'54.61','62.230000000000004','19.05087954','34.01942775',11.0,14.0,'Miscellaneous Class',0.4,'Weekly Brushing',0.6,'Seasonal',1.0,'Needs Lots of Activity',0.6,'Agreeable',0.6,'Alert/Responsive');

INSERT INTO breeds VALUE('Golden Retriever','The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a “merry action.”The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth’s great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes. The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America’s most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.','Friendly, Intelligent, Devoted','3','54.61','60.96','24.947580350000003','34.01942775',10.0,12.0,'Sporting Group',0.4,'Weekly Brushing',0.6,'Seasonal',1.0,'Needs Lots of Activity',1.0,'Eager to Please',0.8,'Friendly');

INSERT INTO breeds VALUE('Hamiltonstovare','Hamiltonstovare are most commonly multi-purpose dogs; they are hunters, show dogs, and pets, all in one regal and versatile little package. As a hound, they follow their nose wherever it goes (and will not return for a good long while), so leashes and fences are a necessity with this breed. Unlike most scent hounds though, the Hamiltonstovare has an extremely high prey drive for both scent and sight. They can make excellent lure coursing dogs. In the home, they are a lazy, low maintenance dog who rarely sheds. Very food motivated, they can be easy to train despite their hound stubbornness, but higher competitive obedience levels are not usually an option. The only major problem with this breed is accessibility; there is only one breeder of Hamiltonstovare in the United States.

INSERT INTO breeds VALUE('Kai Ken','Kai Ken are athletic and intelligent with a strong desire to hunt. The Kai is an independent thinker and can form a strong bond with their family. They are excellent swimmers and climbers and have been known to climb trees and swim rivers in pursuit of game. Kai have a distinct brindle coat that comes in three colors: Black Brindle (Kuro-Tora), Brindle (Chu-Tora), and Red Brindle (Aka-Tora). Red brindle is the rarest of the coat colors. The distinct coloring and brindle pattern enabled the dog to blend in to the mountainous forests in which it hunted, camouflaging it against prey and predators in ancient times. The amount of brindle will vary from dog to dog as well as the brindle pattern. Most puppies are born completely black and their brindle will emerge as they age and will continue to change for around the first five years of their life. In the home, the Kai Ken requires basic canine care. They can be kept in an apartment setting provided they receive regular exercise in the form of leashed walks. Being a naturally clean breed, bathing should be limited to only when dirty. Brushing is recommended, especially during twice-a-year coat blowing.

INSERT INTO breeds VALUE('Stabyhoun','The Stabyhoun’s independent nature was a deliberately bred characteristic by farmers who wanted a dog that could hunt independently for moles and rabbits. That propensity we still see today, therefore, you cannot be upset if he looks for prey independently and, for example, digs in the garden. With proper guidance, a Staby is a gentle dog and a great friend for life.Stabys are also very inquisitive. Always pay attention to what a Stabyhoun is up to because with their inquisitive nature, they can quickly get into trouble. If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no “surprises” in store before calming down again.This breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands. The majority of Stabyhouns are black and white. The brown and white coloring is seen in the Netherlands, but the orange and white Stabyhoun is nearly extinct. The Staby’s build is such that it is greater in length than in height and similarly, the head shows more length than width. The feathering on his chest, collar, forelegs, trousers and tail gives the Staby the impression of being longhaired, but the coat is not excessively long. The Stabyhoun is considered to be an “all-around” dog, with abilities in hunting, retrieving, and pointing. They are also ideal family dogs because of their size and affectionate character.

The Whippet exhibits the classic “inverted S” lines of the sighthound. The deep chest and trim waist; a lean head supported by a long, arched neck; and slim but sturdy legs combine in a picture of an agile, fleet-footed athlete.Between bursts of intense pursuit, Whippets love to stretch out and relax for long hours, enjoying the role of a loving, and loved, companion. Whippets like a fenced yard to run in, but they do nicely in cozy apartments too—as long as they are exercised properly. Another plus for city dwellers: Whippets rarely bark. Despite the breed’s elegant looks, the Whippet is a robust, low-maintenance dog. The sleek, sweet-faced Whippet, the “Poor Man’s Racehorse,” is lightning quick. He is an amiable, dignified, and gentle soul, but give him something to chase and he’s all business. The name Whippet is synonymous with streamlined grace.','Affectionate, Playful, Calm','61','45.72','55.88','11.33980925','18.143694800000002',12.0,15.0,'Hound Group',0.2,'Occasional Bath/Brush',0.4,'Occasional',0.6,'Regular Exercise',0.4,'Independent',0.4,'Reserved with Strangers');

He has been successfully used to manage a variety of stock, including reindeer, goats, cattle and of course sheep. Kelpies in Sweden have gained police dog titles and have pulled sleds. They are also being widely used as search and rescue dogs.Kelpies need companionship. Though he can be content to stay for hours on the chain, he also needs to be with you for some time each day and needs exercise, walks or games with a ball or a stick. One cannot expect this dog, which has been bred to work, to stay outside the house without any mental or physical stimulation. Inevitably, he will set about looking for an occupation, which could include chasing cars, trying to ‘work’ them as he would control sheep. A Working Kelpie makes a fine family dog, gets along well with ‘his’ children and, because they are naturally gentle, almost all Working Kelpies live peaceably with other family pets. The Working Kelpie is extremely alert, eager and highly intelligent. He possesses an open, friendly, active but placid disposition with a good balance between keenness to work and ability to relax.

INSERT INTO breeds VALUE('Yakutian Laika','For centuries the Yakutian Laika was an irreplaceable and faithful assistant of a man in the conditions where the slightest demonstration of weakness was punished with death. It always received respectful attitude from its human family, which treated it as its member rather than a simple domestic animal. This means that it developed into a fabulous companion dog, devoted, lively and biddable. The breed is extremely gentle and considerate with children to whom it commonly establishes especially tight bonds. Nevertheless its friendly nature doesn’t exclude the necessity of a certain amount of socialization, preferably at an early age.The Yakutian Laika is slightly reserved with unknown people but in most cases it’s excited to acquire a new playmate. Human aggressiveness was considered by dogs’ breeders as a major fault and was meticulously eliminated from its characteristics. The breed is endowed with a very sensitive nose and ears, which make it a rather capable watchdog. However its barking is no more than a means to show its anticipation of the perspective of making a new acquaintance. This dog will most likely fail in the role of a guardian due to its friendly nature.Yakutian Laikas used to pull a narta (sled) in close collaboration with dozens of other dogs, so they’re quite accepting of other dogs. The breed surely prefers to have one or several constant canine companions and can be introduced with few issues to the household with a pre-existing dog, although it should be performed with necessary caution. The second primary duty of this breed was hunting and it preserves much of its prey drive. That’s why its communication with other small and average-sized animals should never go unsupervised. The Yakutian Laika will most likely get on with a home cat if they have been reared together. Yakutian Laikas are used for herding, pulling sleds and hunting.

It is muscular and powerful enough to work all day, without sacrificing the speed and agility necessary to cope with bolting livestock. Its gait is free and easy, and it must be able to change direction or speed instantly. Its double coat is weather resistant, with the outer coat of medium texture and length, straight to wavy. The expression is keen, intelligent and eager.','The Australian shepherd has a great deal of stamina and is loving, bold, alert, confident, independent, smart and responsive. If it doesn''t get a chance to exercise and challenge its strongly developed mental and physical activities, it is apt to become frustrated and difficult to live with. With proper exercise and training, it is a loyal, utterly devoted and obedient companion. It is reserved with strangers and has a protective nature. It may try to herd children and small animals by nipping.'),
	('American Cocker Spaniel','The smallest member of the sporting group, the American Cocker Spaniel should be compact and sturdy. Its gait is ground-covering, strong and effortless. The coat is silky, flat or slightly wavy, not overly long. Excessive coat can hinder the dog in the field. The head and expression are hallmarks of the breed; the expression is soft and appealing. Though seldom used for its original purpose, the cocker should still be able to spend a day in the field and should be balanced and athletic. It is true, however, that most cockers now have too much coat for field work.','This breed is known as the "merry" cocker, and the name is most fitting. It is playful, cheerful, amiable, sweet, sensitive, willing to please and responsive to its family''s wishes. It is not known for retaining its hunting instincts, but it is inquisitive and will appreciate a country outing. It is equally at home in the city and will happily walk on leash for its exercise needs. Some bark a lot; some are overly submissive.'),
	('Akita','This is a large and powerful breed, with much substance and heavy bone; it is slightly longer than tall. The Akita''s build reflects its original job of hunting big game through deep snow and rugged terrain. Its double coat consists of a dense undercoat and a straight, harsh, outer coat — about 2 inches or less in length — standing off from the body. Such a combination provides ample insulation from water and weather. Its gait is brisk and powerful. The Akita is a versatile dog of large spitz type. It is able to perform as a hunting companion and protector.','As befitting its spitz-like heritage, the Akita is bold, independent, stubborn and tenacious. Demonstrative to its family, it is utterly devoted and will protect family members. It is reserved with strangers and can be aggressive toward other dogs. It can be domineering. Though not the breed for everyone, in the right hands the Akita is an excellent companion.'),
	('Australian Cattle Dog','The Australian Cattle Dog is of moderate build, enabling it to combine great endurance with bursts of speed and the extreme agility necessary in controlling unruly cattle. It is sturdy and compact, slightly longer than it is tall. Its gait is supple and tireless, and it must be capable of quick and sudden movement. Its ability to stop quickly is aided by the rudderlike action of its tail (which is never docked). Its weather-resistant coat consists of a short, dense undercoat and moderately short, straight outer coat of medium texture.','Smart, hardy, independent, stubborn, tenacious, energetic and untiring — these are all traits essential to a driver of headstrong cattle, and all traits of the Australian cattle dog. This dog must have a job to do or it will expend its efforts on unacceptable jobs of its own. Given challenging mental and hard physical exercise daily, it is among the most responsive and obedient of dogs, an exemplary partner in adventure. It tends to nip at the heels of running children.'),
	('Airedale Terrier','The Airedale terrier is a neat, upstanding, long-legged terrier, not exaggerated in any way. It has strong round bone and combines strength and agility, enabling it to hunt tough game. Its jaws are strong and punishing. Its gait is free. The coat is hard, dense and wiry; it lies straight and close, with some hair crinkling or waving.','Among the most versatile of terriers, the Airedale is bold, playful and adventurous; it is a lively yet protective companion. It is intelligent, but often stubborn and headstrong. Some can be domineering, but most are biddable, reliable and responsive to their owner''s wishes. It makes a good house dog as long as it gets daily mental and physical exercise. It likes to be the head dog and may not do well when another dog challenges that position, although they usually get along well with smaller dogs.'),
	('Alaskan Malamute','The Alaskan malamute is a powerfully built dog of Nordic breed type, developed to haul heavy loads rather than race. It is slightly longer than it is tall. It is heavy-boned and compact, designed for strength and endurance. Its gait is steady, balanced and tireless. Its coat is thick and double, with a coarse outer coat and dense, wooly, oily undercoat, providing the ultimate in insulation. Although its eyes have a "wolf-like" appearance, its expression is soft.','The Alaskan malamute is powerful, independent, strong-willed and fun-loving. Its idea of great fun is to pull a sled or cart, but it also loves to run and roam. It is family-oriented, and as long as it is given daily exercise, it is well-mannered in the home. Without proper exercise, it can become frustrated and destructive. It is friendly and sociable toward people, but it may be aggressive toward strange dogs, pets or livestock. Some can be domineering. It tends to dig and howl.'),
	('American Staffordshire Terrier','This stocky dog should be muscular, giving the impression not only of great strength for its size but also of grace and agility. Its gait is springy. Its low center of gravity helped it stay on its feet in a fight, and its nimbleness helped it avoid its opponent''s teeth. Its own jaws are strong with great power. Its coat is short, close and glossy.','Typically docile and playful with its family, the American Staffordshire terrier is also generally friendly toward strangers as long as its owners are present. It is generally very good with children. It is a protective breed and can be aggressive toward other dogs — especially those that challenge it. It is stubborn, tenacious and fearless. For all of its tough persona, the most important thing in life to this breed is its owner''s fond attention.'),
	('Anatolian Shepherd Dog','The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is built tough to do a tough job. It is a large, powerful, rugged dog, having both great agility and endurance. It has good bone and a large head. Its gait is powerful, smooth and fluid. Its coat consists of a thick undercoat and an outer coat that ranges from short (about 1 inch) to rough (about 4 inches), slightly longer around the neck and mane. Its expression is intelligent, and the general impression it gives is one of a bold yet calm protector.','This is a serious dog, devoted to its family and its duty as family protector. At the same time, it is laid back-and easygoing, never on the lookout for trouble. It is suspicious of strangers and is territorial. It is good with children, but it may not be playful enough to satisfy children''s desires. As a serious watchdog, it tends to bark a lot when its suspicions are aroused.'),
	('American Eskimo Dog','The Eskie is built along classic Nordic lines, a form that has proved effective at pulling heavy loads through snow and ice. It is compactly built, slightly longer than tall. The stand-off, double coat resists soaking and provides insulation against the cold. The small thick ears are also cold-resistant. The breed''s smaller size has moved it from the realm of sled dog, but it remains a sled dog in miniature. Its trot is agile and bold. The expression is keen and alert.','The American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively and fun-loving — in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion. True to its spitz heritage, it is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. But it is among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and it is calm and well-mannered inside. It is good with children, other dogs, and pets and is generally outgoing to everyone.'),
	('Afghan Hound','The Afghan is built along greyhound-like lines, enabling it to execute a double-suspension gallop and run-down fleet game. The comparatively short back and steep pelvis helped it to leap great heights and to turn almost in place, essential attributes for coursing in rocky mountainous terrain. The large feet gave it a better foothold and were more resistant to injury on rough ground. The silky coat protected the dog from cold nights at high altitudes. The Afghan appears dignified and aloof, with an exotic expression and proud carriage. This dog''s gait shows great elasticity and spring; the Afghan moves with its head and tail high.','Despite its glamorous reputation, the Afghan hound is a hunter at heart, bred to chase down game over rugged terrain. While it maintains its regal bearings inside, it needs a daily chance to stretch its legs in a safe area. Its worst trait is a reluctance to come when called. It will chase small animals outside; inside, it will coexist peacefully. Though gentle with children, it may not be playful and interactive enough with them. Described by some as "catlike," it is independent yet sensitive and not overly demonstrative. It is reserved with strangers; some can be timid. It has a gay, clownish side.'),
	('American Hairless Terrier','The American Hairless Terrier is a smoothly muscled, active, smallest to small terrier. The preferred ratio of length of body (prosternum to point of buttocks) to height (withers to ground) to is 10:9. The head is broad, slightly domed, wedge-shaped, and proportionate to the size of the body. Ears are V-shaped, set at the outside edges of the skull, and may be erect, tipped or button. Both varieties may have a natural tail carried in an upward curve, or the tail may be docked in dogs of the coated variety. The American Hairless Terrier comes in a number of skin colors and patterns (hairless variety) and coat colors and patterns (coated variety).','The American Hairless Terrier is an energetic, alert dog whose curiosity and intelligence make him easy to train. The ancestors of this breed were bred to hunt. The lack of coat makes the hairless variety unsuited for hunting, but both varieties still have a strong hunting instinct and the coated dogs are fearless, tenacious hunters with seemingly unlimited energy. The American Hairless Terrier is an exceptionally friendly companion, getting along well with children, other dogs, and even cats. American Hairless Terriers enjoy human companionship immensely and will enthusiastically share any activity with their owners. The hairless dogs require protection from the sun and winter cold weather. American Hairless Terriers should not be sparred during conformation judging.'),
	('Australian Terrier','The Australian Terrier is small, sturdy and medium-boned; it is long in proportion to height. This is a working terrier that should exhibit a ground-covering gait and hard condition. Its weatherproof coat is made up of a short, soft undercoat and a harsh, straight, outer coat, about 2.5 inches long, shorter on the tail and lower legs. It sports a ruff around the neck and a topknot of longer hair adds to its keen, intelligent expression.','One of the quieter terriers, the Aussie is nonetheless a plucky, tough character, ready to go after a rodent when the chance arises. It is fun-loving and adventurous, and needs daily exercise to keep it from becoming frustrated. It is clever and generally eager to please, making it one of the more obedient terriers. It gets along fairly well with other dogs and household pets. It is reserved with strangers. Reflecting its earth dog heritage, it does like to dig.'),
	('American Water Spaniel','The American water spaniel packs a lot of ability into a comparatively small dog. Its muzzle is long and strong enough to carry a large goose, and it has strong quarters to propel it through water and over land. It is slightly longer than tall, solidly built and muscular. The coat can range from uniform waves (marcel) to close curls, with a dense undercoat. This combination provides protection against weather, water or briars. The ears are well-covered with hair, which should not grow into the ear canal. The gait is balanced, with reach and drive.','As its name implies, the American water spaniel is a natural lover of water. Not only is it a skilled retriever and versatile hunter, but it is also a tractable fun-loving family dog — as long as it gets regular physical and mental exercise. It is sensitive and willing to please. Some can be timid. Generally good with other dogs in the household, some are aggressive toward strange dogs. Barking can be a definite problem; some also whine or drool.'),
	('Affenpinscher','The Affenpinscher is square-proportioned, compact and sturdy, with medium bone. It is a smaller version of a working terrier, and as such is not a delicate dog. This is an active, tough dog that is agile enough to catch and dispatch rats and mice. Its gait is light, sound and confident. The affenpinscher has a monkeylike facial expression with long eyebrows and beard, which lends it an air of comic seriousness. This breed''s rough coat is about 1 inch long on its body and somewhat longer on its head, neck, chest, stomach and legs. The coat type provided protection from vermin and harsh conditions.','The affenpinscher lives up to its name — "monkey terrier" — in both looks and actions. A terrier at heart, it is busy, inquisitive, bold and stubborn, but it also loves to monkey around, being playful and mischievous. It tends to bark and even climb. Unlike most terriers, it is fairly good with other dogs and pets. This little dog is best with a family that likes entertainment and has a very good sense of humor.'),
	('American English Coonhound','Renowned for his speed and endurance, the American English Coonhound has the strength, grace and attitude of a well-conditioned athlete. Capable of hunting fox and raccoon all night long, he has an effortless trot that shows off this endurance. The breed''s hard, protective coat is of medium length and can be red and white ticked, blue and white ticked, tri-colored with ticking, red and white, and white and black.','He is an ideal partner to go running or cycling with. They need mental and physical stimulation to keep them occupied, fit and healthy. He will enjoy both a jog in the park as well as a nap on the couch. Keep in mind, these dogs are prey-driven and should always be walked on a leash. This hound needs a firm, but kind, hand for successful training. The American English Coonhound takes more time to train, repetition and patience are the name of the game. This breed can be easily distracted more so than the other Coonhound breeds. They need consistent and gentle guidance during training. Start training this breed early and your training work is lifelong.'),
	('American Foxhound','The American foxhound is slighter of bone and higher on leg than the English foxhound, with more rear angulation and arch over the loin. These attributes give it greater speed and agility for hunting over rough terrain. It has a melodious voice when on the trail. Its coat is hard and of medium length. Its expression is gentle and pleading.','Although by tradition the foxhound is not a house pet, it is actually well-mannered in the home. It gets along best with human or canine companionship. It is a tolerant, amiable and gentle dog, even though it is not very demonstrative. Most are reserved with strangers. It is first and foremost a hunter, ever ready to hit the trail. It needs daily exercise in a safe area. Once on a scent, it will follow gleefully, heedless of commands. This is a dog that likes the outdoors; it is not a city dog. It bays.'),
	('Azawakh','Morphology is very similar to that of the Middle Eastern and South Indian sight hounds, all swift, high-bred coursing hounds, although there are several obvious differences. For example, a short, flat back combined with long legs place the hips higher than the withers. The Azawakh is almond eyed and thin. It moves with a distinctly feline gait and can be found in a variety of colors as well as varying degrees of refinement, though format is basically constant. The standards call for a hound from 33 to 55 pounds (15 to 25 kg); its height is 24 to 29 inches (61 to 74 cm). The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are "dry", meaning that they are quite flat, unlike the Greyhound and Whippet. In this respect it is similar in type to the Saluki.','Relative to its native environment, the smooth-coated Azawakh hound mentally and structurally manifests his vocation as hunter, protector and companion. Quick, attentive, distant, proud and alert, he remains instinctively reserved with strangers and gentle with those he loves. Socialize well. Especially slender and elegant, his frame and muscles are visible under a dry, fine skin. The Azawakh has a natural tendency to guard. Be sure you are this dog''s calm, but firm, confident and consistent pack leader. Does best with an owner who is even-tempered, displaying a natural, but gentle authority over the dog. Independent and exceptionally fast, these dogs can reach up to 37 mph (60 km/h).'),
	('American Pit Bull Terrier','The Pit Bull immediately strikes one as being a dog of power, passion and undying willingness. The brick-like head, which is especially broad between the cheeks (to house the powerful jaws), is carried upon a thickly muscled, well-defined neck. The neck runs into a deep, thick, well-sprung chest. The American Pit Bull is a very muscular, stocky, yet agile dog that is extremely strong for his size.The tail tapers to a point. The ears are generally cropped, though this is optional. Docked tails are not accepted by the UKC or the ADBA. The eyes are round. Both the ADBA and the UKC do not accept blue eyes or the coat color merle. The American Pitbull Registry does accept a merle coat. The teeth should form a scissors bite. Its coat is made up of thick, short, shiny hair. All colors are admissible. Shades of brown to red with a matching red/brown nose are referred to as red-nose Pit Bulls. Shades of gray with a matching gray nose are referred to as blue-nose Pit Bulls.','The essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed’s natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.'),
	('American White Shepherd','The White Shepherd is a medium-sized, well-balanced, muscular dog, slightly longer than tall, with a medium length, pure white coat, erect ears, and a low-set natural tail that normally reaches to the hock and is carried in a slight curve like a saber. The outline of the White Shepherd is made up of smooth curves rather than angles. Gender differences are readily apparent. The White Shepherd should be evaluated as an all-around working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they deviate from breed type; and how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work. Working dogs are not to be penalized under any conditions for scars or blemishes that are due to occupational injuries.','The White Shepherd has a distinct personality marked by self-confidence. The breed is poised, but when the situation demands, they are eager, alert and ready to serve in any capacity. White Shepherds demonstrate both herding and protective instincts. With those he/she knows, the White Shepherd is open and friendly. With strangers, she/he is observant and may be somewhat aloof but not apprehensive. They enjoy running, playing fetch or any activity with their human family. This is a joyful, active, intelligent and easy to train working dog with the ability to adapt and integrate to all kinds of social events and situations. Timidity in a mature dog or aggressive behavior is not typical of this breed. White Shepherds are very loyal and tend to be especially protective of the young of various species. With their playful and curious personalities, they make wonderful companions although some do have the tendency toward being quite vocal by exhibiting whining, grunting, moaning and sometimes howling.'),
	('Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog','The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is a well-developed, exaggerated bulldog with a broad head and natural drop ears. The prominent muzzle is covered by loose upper lips. The prominent eyes are set well apart. The Alapaha''s coat is relatively short and fairly stiff. Preferred colors are blue merle, brown merle, or red merle all trimmed in white or chocolate and white. Also preferred are the glass eyes (blue) or marble eyes (brown and blue mixed in a single eye). The ears and tail are never trimmed or docked. The body is sturdy and very muscular. The well-muscled hips are narrower than the chest. The straight back is as long as the dog is high at the shoulders. The dewclaws are never removed and the feet are cat-like.','The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is dutiful and quickly trainable. This breed is named as such for its streak of "royalty." It is a great watch and guard dog. They will fight to the death to defend their owners and make excellent companion dogs. Excellent with and protective of children. These are active, athletic and mindful dogs with a lot of heart. The objective in training this dog is to achieve a pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in their pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader; lines are clearly defined. You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a complete success.'),
	('Alaskan Klee Kai','The Alaskan Klee Kai is a small version of a type of dog referred to as the Alaskan Husky, with a wedge-shaped head featuring a striking masked face, prick ears, and a double coat. The length of body is just slightly longer than the height. The tail is well-furred and curls over the back or to either side when the dog is alert or moving. The appearance of the Alaskan Klee Kai reflects the breed’s Northern heritage.','The most distinctive characteristic of the Alaskan Klee Kai is the facial mask, which must be clearly visible due to contrasting colors. The full face mask is the most desirable. The Alaskan Klee Kai is very curious, active, quick and agile. His loyalty and alertness make the Alaskan Klee Kai an excellent watchdog, who may be territorial despite his small size. While affectionate with family members, the Alaskan Klee Kai is reserved and cautious with strangers and in unfamiliar situations.'),
	('Appenzeller Sennenhund','The Appenzeller Sennenhund is a medium-sized mountain dog, 18.5-23 ins (47–58 cm) at the withers and weighing 49-71 lbs (22–32 kg). Like the other Sennenhunds, the Appenzeller Sennenhund has a heavy, molosser-like build and a distinctive tricolour coat. The breed''s ears are small and triangular, set high and hanging down against the dog''s cheeks, similar to a button ear. Faults in the breed''s appearance include wall eye, kinked tail, a single coat, and a coat that is not tricolour.','As with all medium to large, very active working dogs, the Appenzeller Sennenhund should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people and provided with regular activity and training if they are to be safely kept as a pet. If trained properly, they bond closely with their owners and like to seek for attention. As a result of careful regulated breeding, the Appenzeller breed, as a whole, though individual genetic lines vary, is an extremely healthy breed. Especially for a dog of its size and weight. According to the breed standard, the Appenzeller Sennenhund are lively, high spirited, athletic and suspicious of strangers. Due to his large size and high energy levels, the Appenzeller Sennenhund is not recommended as an apartment dog.'),
	('Australian Bulldog','(Aussie Bulldog) Australian Bulldogs have stout, compact bodies that are very strong and well-muscled. Generally, the bodies of female Australian Bulldogs should be longer than those of their male counterparts. Australian Bulldogs have a level top line and a broad chest with the brisket well let down. Their tail cartridge is straight off the back, and their tail may or may not be docked. Australian Bulldogs have a very strong, square head that is substantially deep and wide at the muzzle. They have a pronounced stop between their large, wide-set eyes. This breed has nose wrinkle. Australian Bulldogs bred for show have a near level bite and large teeth. Their wide jaw structure should be square at the top and bottom. Australian Bulldogs have a short, smooth coat that exists in a variety of colors. There are at least five shades of brindle that are suitable for show. Australian Bulldogs may also have a pied coat, meaning there is one coat color on the body that is more prominent than another. Australian Bulldogs often have a series of patches on their body.','The Australian Bulldog is a medium sized dog that loves being part of a family. The Aussie Bulldog is intelligent, loving and loyal with a sound temperament. Good with children and fun-loving, this breed is pretty easygoing. It will enjoy playing with a ball or Frisbee and loves to play or swim in water. It is a good watch dog but not a guard dog, though its appearance can be a deterrent. Given the alertness of this breed, the Aussie Bulldog does have the ability to be a dependable watch dog at a mature age. With its intelligence and loyalty it is a very easy dog to teach at home, but obedience training is recommended (as with any breed of dog). The Aussie Bulldog has stamina and its personality is one everyone could get attached to. This breed craves leadership from its owners. Like all dogs, they need a firm, but calm, confident and consistent pack leader and daily mental and physical exercise to avoid any behavior issues.'),
	('Australian Kelpie','The Australian Kelpie, or simply Kelpie, is an Australian sheep dog successful at mustering and droving with little or no guidance. It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats. The Australian Kelpie has a compact body and well-developed limbs. Slightly longer than he is tall, the Kelpie has a broad chest and firm hindquarters that contribute to his flexible, energized appearance. The head is long and narrow. The medium length tail is low set. The short, compact feet have well arched toes. The double coat consists of a short and dense undercoat and a hard, straight and weather-repellent outer coat. Color possibilities include black and red, each with or without tan and fawn, chocolate and blue. Kelpie owners are more interested in the breed''s working ability then its appearance.','The Kelpie is extremely alert, eager and highly intelligent, with a mild, tractable disposition, marked loyalty and devotion to duty. It has a natural instinct and aptitude in the working of livestock, both in a confined area and in open country. An open, friendly, alert but placid disposition is essential, with a good balance between keenness to work and ability to rest.'),
	('Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog','The Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is a normally proportioned, rugged dog with pricked (standing up) ears and long legs. The breed''s most distinctive feature, for which the breed is named, is the frequent lack of a tail. When there is a tail, it is quite short, no longer than 10 cm (4 ins), and undocked. The coat is medium length to short, straight, dense and harsh. The coat color is a speckled red or speckled blue. 46–51 centimetres (18–20 in) at the withers for dogs, with females slightly smaller. The Australian Cattle Dog is a related breed (with a long tail) that is similar in appearance to the Stumpy, but the Australian Cattle is proportionally heavier and less leggy.','The “Stumpy” possesses a natural aptitude in the working and controlling of cattle, and a loyal, courageous and devoted disposition. It is ever alert, watchful and obedient, though suspicious of strangers. At all times, it must be amenable to handling in the show ring. Any deviation from the standard is considered a fault and is to be penalized according to the degree of deviation.'),
	('Austrian Black and Tan Hound','Colouring in this breed is highly important; it must be black with small, clearly defined, light to dark fawn markings. Two fawn marks above the eyes must be present. The coat is smooth, dense and short (about 2 cm in length). The long tail is slightly bent and the ears are medium in length and lie flat with rounded tips. Males are 50–56 centimetres (20–22 inches), while females are 48–54 centimetres (19–21 inches). They weigh 15 to 22 kg (33-49 pounds).','It has a keen sense of smell. It is an elegant runner, used in all sorts of game. It has a lovely voice, and makes a great pet due to its good-natured personality. It is not a dog wanting to be in a city. A suitable home will be in a rural area where the dog will have lots of space to run unrestricted by a leash. It loves to work.'),
	('Austrian Pinscher','The Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher has a pear-shaped head. The powerful muzzle is relatively short. The feet have well-arched toes. The elbows are fairly close to the body. The chest is wide and well developed. It has a short, hard topcoat as well as undercoat. Coat colors come in red, black, brown, fawn, brindle or black/tan, with limited white markings common. The tail is docked or left-curled over the back.','The breed is described as "a pleasant companion" for rural and suburban areas. The breed standard describes the ideal Austrian Pinscher''s temperament and character as playful, not inclined to be a hunter, and being an "incorruptible guard". Assertive, lively and alert, the breed is devoted to people it is familiar with and suspicious of strangers, making it a useful guard dog.'),
	('Alaskan Husky','The Alaskan Husky is not considered a pure breed. It is defined only by its purpose, which is that of a highly efficient sled dog. The husky is a blend of various Northern breeds, chosen particularly for skills such as pulling. Specializations in type exist within the category, such as freighting dogs (Mackenzie River husky, Malamute), sprint Alaskans (Eurohound), and distance Alaskans.','Alaskan Huskies are primarily bred as working dogs. They have greater endurance in sled racing than Siberian Huskies do. Gentle and playful, this cheerful dog is very fond of his or her family. A puppy at heart, they are clever, sociable and loving, easy-going and docile, though they do generally have a lot of energy, especially as puppies. Good with children and friendly with strangers, they are not watchdogs, for they bark little and love everyone. Huskies are very intelligent and trainable, but they have a mind of their own and will only obey a command if they see the point and if you do not display leadership, they will not see the point in obeying you. Training takes patience, consistency and an understanding of the Arctic dog character.'),
	('American Bulldog','The American Bulldog is a powerful, athletic short-coated dog, strongly muscled, and well boned. The body is just slightly longer than tall. The head is large and broad, with a wide muzzle. Ears are small to medium in size, high set, and may be drop, semi-prick, rose, or cropped. The tail may be docked or natural. The American Bulldog comes in solid colors, white with colored patches, and brindle. Gender differences are well expressed in this breed, with males typically larger and more muscular than females. Honorable scars resulting from field work are not to be penalized. The American Bulldog should be evaluated as a working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','The essential characteristics of the American Bulldog are those which enable it to work as a hog and cattle catching dog, and a protector of personal property. These tasks require a powerful, agile, confident dog with a large head and powerful jaws. The American Bulldog is a gentle, loving family companion who is fearless enough to face an angry bull or a human intruder. Note: It is common for young American Bulldogs to be somewhat standoffish with strangers, and judges should not penalize this. By the time the dog is around 18 months of age, however, the breed’s normal confidence asserts itself.'),
	('Andalusian Hound','As in the Portuguese Podengo, the Andalusian Hound comes in three sizes (large, medium and small) and with three types of coat (wire-haired, long-haired and smooth). This combination of factors can results in nine different varieties. There is also a dwarf or basset variety derived from a medium-sized short-haired Andalusian Hound — called Maneto from its short, stout legs — which the RSCE has provisionally accepted as a distinct breed.','Andalusian Podencos, like other hounds, have excellent sight, hearing and smell, which makes them good hunters, often employed for hunting rabbits. Andalusians and mastiffs form the heart of the rehalas (teams of 20 to 24 hunting dogs) of central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula; medium and smaller dogs search out deer or wild boar, whilst the larger hounds are used for attacking the prey. One of the most typical functions of the large Andalusian hound was that of the so-called quitaor accompanying the Spanish Greyhound colleras during hare hunting. The quitaor‘s job consisted primarily of flushing out the hares from their home or hiding place and killing them; then, together with the Greyhounds, retrieving them for the owner. In Andalusian farmhouses the larger hounds were used as watchdogs, and the smaller hounds were used to kill rodents.'),
	('American Mastiff','The American Mastiff has a much drier mouth than other Mastiffs. The drier mouth is due to outcrossing the English Mastiff with Anatolian Mastiff, which occurred early in the development of the breed. The American Mastiff is a large, massive and powerful dog. Temperament: Dignity rather than gaiety; quiet, calm, loving and loyal. Protective, but not aggressive.','The American Mastiff loves children and is totally devoted to its family. It is non-aggressive except in those instances when its family, especially the children, are threatened. In those instances it becomes a courageous defender. The American Mastiff is wise, kind and gentle, patient and understanding, very loving with its own people, neither shy nor vicious. It is loyal and devoted. Since these dogs are of the Mastiff type and grow to be very large, this breed should only be with an owner who knows how to display strong leadership.The objective in training this dog is to achieve pack leader status.'),
	('Akbash Dog','The white Akbash Dog is a long-legged, lean, muscular dog of imposing size and strength, great courage, and stamina, with an alert, regal bearing. The Akbash Dog is slightly longer in proportion than tall, has a wedge-shaped head with pendant ears, and a long tail, usually carried in a curl over the back when the dog is moving or excited. The Akbash Dog represents a very rare and special mixture of Mastiff and gazehound characteristics that are important to maintain. The gazehound influence is apparent in the breed''s long legs, deep chest, arched loin, shallow lower jaw, tucked up flank, speed, and agility, while the Mastiff''s contributions can be seen in the breed''s height, weight, broader head, and overall impression of power. When judging this breed, preference should be given to Akbash Dogs who exhibit a perfect balance between the two types.Gender differences can be striking in this breed. Typically the dog is proportionately taller and heavier than the female. The bitch appears feminine in comparison to the dog. There is no difference in the ability of males or females to perform as guardians.','The essential characteristics of the Akbash Dog are those that enable it to perform successfully as a livestock guardian. Akbash Dogs have the size, strength, and courage to challenge large predators and the speed and agility to chase fleet predators. Their temperament is calm, quiet, and steady. They are independent and capable of correctly responding to changing circumstances without human direction. The Akbash Dog is also highly suitable as a home companion or estate guardian. The Akbash Dog is loyal, gentle, and quietly affectionate with its own family, including children and family pets, but remains aloof and suspicious toward strangers. It is also by nature watchful of other dogs and may, on its own territory, react aggressively to intruding dogs. Although independent in nature, the Akbash Dog responds well to basic training. Properly socialized and trained, the Akbash Dog is an ideal family pet and home guardian.'),
	('Alano Espanol','The Alano Español is a very large dog of the Molosser type, with a large, strong head. Males should be no smaller than 58 centimetres (23 in) at the withers, and should weigh 34–40 kilograms (75–88 lb) with females somewhat smaller. The coat is short and thick but never velvety, and is most often a brindle of any color; leonardo (fawn);black and brindle; sable wolf. White chest flashes are acceptable but prevalence of white is not. The face may or may not have a black mask. The muzzle is short with the lower jaw slightly concave, and has a very large, broad, black nose. The ears are set high and may be drop or cut short. The skin is very thick, with neck folds and some wrinkles on the face.','Since the breed was used for hunting in packs, it is very sociable with other dogs. All large dogs must be well socialized with humans and other animals when young, if they are to be safely kept as pets. Large working dogs, such as the Alano Español, need regular training and activity all of their lives.'),
	('Ariege Pointer','The Ariege Pointer breed is a normally proportioned dog with drop ears. The tail is traditionally docked. The coat is short and primarily white, speckled with larger patches of colours described as orange, liver, or chestnut on the head and ears. Size is about 60–67 centimetres (24–26 in) in height at the withers. Dogs of the breed should appear powerful but without excessive heaviness, robust and of strong.','The Braque de l’Ariège is quick and energectic. It is also very independent so needs regular training and activity. It also needs regular brushing.'),
	('Ariegeois','The Ariegeois normally weighs approximately 28–30 kg. Males should stand 52–58 cm tall, and females 50–56 cm. The coat is smooth and short, white with clearly defined black markings; it is sometimes mottled, and there may be tan points at the head. The head of the dog is lean and elongated. There are no wrinkles. The eyes are dark and gentle. The ears are very soft and medium-length. The muzzle is of medium length, and the nose is black. The neck is slender and arched slightly, to the chest which is narrow and deep. The ribs are well-sprung with a strong, sloping back. It should have straight forelegs and strong, powerful hindlegs. The feet are hard and foxlike. The tail is slightly curved. Overall, the Ariegeois is a talented scenthound, and affectionate and serene in the home. The Ariegeois is now being bred in Italy and used to hunt wild boar, performing well in this endeavour under Italian conditions.','Good speed; a degree of endurance not generally found in hounds of this size. A surprisingly deep, powerful voice and remarkable scenting ability. Of even temperament, essentially friendly and social. As a hunting/working scenthound breed, and being called upon to work in close proximity with other hounds and their handlers, aggression towards other hounds and people is to be considered a fault.'),
	('Africanis','The Africanis is a short-coated, medium-sized dog, well-muscled and slightly longer than tall. It can be of any colour and occasionally comes with a ridgeback.(Regarding the ridged back, according to the Africanis Society of South Africa: A ridge of varying form can exceptionally be seen on the back. It has sadly been established that this mutation can be associated with a dermoid sinus. Therefore, ‘ridged’ individuals are not recommended for breeding). There is also a wire-haired variety of the breed, but it is relatively rare. The height usually varies from 50 to 60 cm (with the tolerance of 2–3 cm).','The Africanis is well disposed without being obtrusive: a friendly dog showing watchful territorial behaviour. The breed is independent and territorial, but highly trainable. They can however, become grumpy as they grow older, and may also become quite difficult when kept with other dogs in a pack.'),
	('Aidi','Standing 53–61 cm (21–24 in) in height and weighing around 55 pounds (25 kg), the Aidi''s lean, muscular body is protected by a coarse, thick, weather-resistant coat with a heavy plumed tail. The coat is heavy and soft. The head is bear-like and in proportion to the rest of the body. The breed has a tapered muzzle with a black or brown nose that usually matches the coat. Their jaws are strong with tight black or brown lips. The medium-sized ears are tipped forward and drop slightly. The eyes are medium, with a dark color and dark rims. Coat colours are white, black, black and white, pale red, and tawny.','The Aidi is energetic and highly protective and is said to make an outstanding watchdog. It is a powerful dog that is also agile, alert, and ready for action. As it is a sensitive breed, the dog needs to be given appropriate training from a very young age. It needs to be exposed to as many social conditions as possible so that it makes an ideal family pet.'),
	('American Staghound','The American Staghound is not recognized as a breed, but is a type of sighthound that is used to pursue (course) a variety of quarry (game). Although it is not recognized as a breed, some "lines" have been bred together longer than some recognized modern breeds. The best way to visualize the American Staghound is to blend together the characteristics of the Scottish Deerhound with the Greyhound. This is a running dog with the physical characteristics that would be referred to as the Greyhound prototype. It has long legs, a deep chest and strong muscles. The Staghound has great visual acuity, and some have been bred for some scenting ability while on course. It can be found in any assortment of color or color patterns that can be found on the Greyhound and Scottish Deerhound. There are three coat types: the "shag," which more closely resembles the Scottish Deerhound; the "slick," which more closely resembles the Greyhound; and the “broken,” which is in between the two. The American Staghound has all of the physical and mental characteristics needed for running down its quarry. It is known for having speeds that approach that of a Greyhound, but unlike a Greyhound, some specimens have incredible endurance.','American Staghounds are generally gentle, calm and affectionate with their family.  Due to the American Staghound''s hunting heritage, the breed usually does poorly as guard dogs as the American Staghound is seldom territorial.'),
	('Alopekis','Alopekis populations existed until recently all over Greece and some of their traditional uses were ratting and the extermination of mice and other small vermin, as well as protection of poultry, such as domestic chickens and ducks from the attacks of foxes; the small dogs can easily fit in the hen coops and curl up inside to spend the night on vigil against their namesake intruder; they also co-operate very well with the bigger flock- guardians and sheepdogs in the farm and on the field. The breed is an excellent and brave little watchdog and quite strong for its size. Before the mass importation of foreign breeds to Greece that started in the 1970s and ''80s, the undisputed majority of small dogs in urban and rural areas were mostly Alopekis and Melieo Kynidio or Kokoni.','The Alopekis as a house companion is very affectionate, reliable, devoted, lively, active but not highly-strung nor yappy dog. The typical temperament is confident, outgoing, sociable, happy and very easy to train. Protective and caring towards the other house pets or animals, yet a determined enemy of vermin, a very diligent little worker, a capable hunter and retriever of game and quite playful. The breed is very good with children. As a utility dog and watchdog the Alopekis is courageous, vigilant, alert, spirited and able to cover the distance tirelessly, athletic and with very quick reflexes. At farm or city this is a very useful little working dog and escort that adapts well to all environments and is a joy to live with for dog-lovers of any age and lifestyle.'),
	('Bulldog','The English Bulldog is a wide, medium-sized, compact dog with short legs. The body and head are massive with extra skin on both the skull and forehead falling in folds. The cheeks extend to the sides of the eyes. The muzzle is wide, short and pug with a broad, deep stop. The black nose is broad with large nostrils. The dark eyes are deep set. The rose ears are small, thin and set high on the head. The jaws are massive, very broad, and square with hanging upper lips. The teeth should have an under bite. The tail is either straight or screwed and carried low. The short, flat coat is straight, smooth and glossy. Coat colors include red brindle and other shades of brindle, solid white, solid red, fawn, fallow, piebald, pale yellow or washed-out red or white or a combination of these colors.','Despite its "sourmug," the bulldog is jovial, comical and amiable, among the most docile and mellow of dogs. It is willing to please, although it retains a stubborn streak. It is very good with children. Most are moderately friendly toward strangers. Although some can be aggressive with strange dogs, the breed is quite good with other pets.'),
	('Beagle','The Beagle should look like a miniature foxhound, solid for its size. The beagle''s moderate size enables it to be followed on foot. It can also be carried to the hunt, and once there, can scurry around in thick underbrush. Its close hard coat protects it from underbrush. Its moderate build enables it to nimbly traverse rough terrain. The beagle''s amiable personality allows it to get along with other dogs and to be a successful pack hunter. The beagle is noted for its melodious bay, which helps hunters locate it from a distance.','One of the most amiable hounds, the beagle was bred as a pack hunter and needs companionship, whether human or canine. It loves to explore the outdoors and is an enthusiastic trailer. Given adequate exercise, it is a calm, tractable house pet. It is an excellent child''s dog, gentle, incredibly tolerant and always ready to join in a game or an adventure. It is an independent breed, however, and may run off if a trail beckons. It barks and howls.'),
	('Boxer','The Boxer is exemplary in its combination of stylish elegance with strength and agility. It is square-proportioned with good substance and musculature. Its stride is free and ground-covering, with proud carriage. Its head is distinctive, with a broad, blunt muzzle and alert expression. Its coat is short and shiny. It is perfectly suited to serve as a working watchdog.','The boxer is playful, exuberant, inquisitive, attentive, demonstrative, devoted and outgoing; it is a perfect companion for an active family. It can be stubborn, but it is sensitive and responsive to commands. It may be aggressive toward strange dogs, but it is generally good with other household dogs and pets.'),
	('Boston Terrier','The Boston terrier is a compactly built, square-proportioned, short-backed, clean-cut dog. It should convey the impression of determination, strength, sturdiness, liveliness, and style, with a graceful carriage. It retains many of the attributes of its bulldog ancestors, but in a clean-cut package that makes a handy house companion. Its short fine coat, with distinctive markings, adds to its dapper appearance.','The Boston is devoted and sensitive to its owner''s wishes and moods. It is well-mannered indoors but saucy and playful (especially enjoying ball chasing) whenever the chance arises. Somewhat stubborn, it is nonetheless clever and learns readily. It is reserved with strangers, and some may be aggressive toward strange dogs. Some bark a lot.'),
	('Bernese Mountain Dog','The Bernese Mountain Dog is slightly longer than tall, though it appears square. It is a sturdy, large, hardy dog capable of both draft and droving work. This requires a combination of strength, speed and agility. Its natural working gait is a slow trot, but with good reach and drive. Its thick coat is moderately long, and slightly wavy or straight, providing insulation from the cold. Its expression is gentle, and its coloring is striking.','The Bernese mountain dog is an easygoing, calm family companion (that is, after it leaves its adolescent stage). It is sensitive, loyal and extremely devoted. It is gentle with children and often reserved with strangers. It generally gets along well with other dogs and pets.'),
	('Brittany','The leggiest of the sporting breeds, the Brittany is square-proportioned, the height at the shoulder equaling the length of the body. It stands slightly higher at the withers than at the rump. It is medium-sized with light bone. The combination of long legs and light bones endows the Brittany with remarkable agility and speed. In fact, the breed is very quick and is noted for its ground-covering side movement at the trot. The Brittany may be born tailless or have the tail docked to about 4 inches. The breed''s coat is far less profuse than that of spaniels and is either flat or wavy. An overly profuse coat is detrimental when hunting in briars and is considered a severe fault. The Brittany''s expression is alert and eager, but soft. The eyes are protected from briars by a fairly heavy eyebrow. The Brittany is an extremely athletic, eager dog that should be ready and able to run in the field for extended periods.','In temperament, the Brittany is friendly and eager to please. These friendly little dogs hunt more like a Setter due to their pointing ability, and are higher on their legs than other Spaniels. The Brittany does not require a heavy hand in training. In fact, they may quit if the discipline is too stern. Much more is accomplished with a gentle hand. They seek human attention, which makes them easier to train than some other hunting breeds. They make close working hunting dogs, fine companions, and family pets.'),
	('Border Collie','This is a medium dog of strong bone, slightly longer than it is tall, combining grace, agility, substance and stamina. Its trot is smooth, ground-covering and tireless, moving with stealth and strength. It is able to change speed and direction suddenly. Border collies must be able to display incredible agility even after working for long periods. The coat can be either smooth or rough. The smooth coat is short all over the body; the rough coat is medium to long in length and flat to slightly wavy in texture. Its expression is intelligent, alert, eager and full of interest, a reflection of its temperament.','The Border Collie is a bundle of mental and physical energy awaiting its chance to be unleashed on the world. Among the most intelligent and obedient of breeds, it is nonetheless a disastrous house dog if it is not given a challenging job every day. Given sufficient exercise, it is a dependable and loyal companion. It is intent on whatever it does and tends to stare, which can be unnerving to other animals. It also likes to chase other animals. It is reserved, even protective, toward strangers.'),
	('Basset Hound','The Basset''s long, heavy body and short legs make it easy to follow on foot and give it an edge in dense cover. The basset hound has heavier bone, in proportion to its total size, than any other breed. Its thick, tight coat protects it from brambles without becoming caught in them. It is speculated that its long ears may stir up ground scent, and the wrinkles trap the scent around the face. The large muzzle gives ample room for the olfactory apparatus. Such room would not be available in a miniature dog; only a large dog with shortened legs can combine the short height with large muzzle size. The basset''s movement is smooth and powerful; it tends to move with nose to the ground.','The Basset Hound is among the most good-natured and easygoing of breeds. It is amiable with dogs, other pets and children, although children must be cautioned not to put strain on its back with their games. It is calm inside, but it needs regular exercise to keep fit. It prefers to investigate slowly, and loves to sniff and trail. It is a talented and determined tracker, not easily dissuaded from its course. Because of this, it may get on a trail and follow it until it becomes lost. It tends to be stubborn and slow-moving. It has a loud bay that it uses when excited on the trail.'),
	('Belgian Malinois','The Belgian Malinois is a sturdy dog of square proportion with moderately heavy, but oval, bone. It is elegant, with very proud head carriage. The overall impression is of power without bulkiness. The gait is smooth and easy, seemingly effortless rather than hard driving. Such a gait gives the impression of tirelessness. The Malinois has a tendency to run in a wide circle rather than a straight line. Its coat is fairly short, straight, and hard, with a dense undercoat. Its expression is intelligent and questioning.','Intense best describes the Belgian Malinois. This is a high-energy breed with a need for regular mental and physical stimulation. It is alert, smart and serious, an ideal watchdog and guard dog. It is aloof with strangers and can be aggressive toward other dogs and animals. Some can be domineering. When confined, it often runs in sweeping circles in an effort to stay on the move. It is protective of its home and family.'),
	('Bichon Frise','The striking powder-puff appearance of the bichon derives from its double coat, with a soft dense undercoat and coarser, curly outer coat, causing the coat to stand off the body and even spring back when patted. It is a merry, agile breed, longer than it is tall, with an effortless trot. Its looks, combined with its fitness, enabled it to earn its living as a street performer. Its soft, inquisitive expression enabled it to worm its way into many hearts and laps.','Bichons love to show off, and they respond well to positive training but not harsh tactics. The Bichon is a naturally gentle, playful dog. Attending an obedience class will benefit both pet and owner. He loves activity and requires regular exercise. Highly intelligent and trainable, Bichons delight in entertaining their owners. Bichons also love to run - and they are fast! Your first ‘Bichon blitz’ will amaze you. If you have a yard, make sure it’s securely fenced and work hard on teaching your dog to listen and come when called.'),
	('Bloodhound','The Bloodhound is a steadfast trailer, built for endurance rather than speed. Its skin is thin and loose, falling in wrinkles around its head and throat. Its long ears are supposed to stir up scents as the ears rake along the ground, and its profuse wrinkles are said to trap the odors around the face, although neither of these assertions has ever been scientifically verified. Its dense short coat protects it from being caught in brambles. Its docile temperament makes it nonthreatening to the humans it is sometimes now called upon to trail. Its gait is elastic and free, with tail held high. Its expression is noble and dignified.','For all its calm manners at home, the bloodhound is a tireless trailer once on the track. It is tough, stubborn and independent, yet it is so gentle and placid that it is extremely trustworthy around children — although it may not be playful enough for some children''s needs. Nonetheless, it is not the lazy ol'' hound dog portrayed in folklore but instead an active, playful companion. Although not the easiest breed to train for traditional obedience, it is exceptionally easy to train in tasks involving trailing. The bloodhound is reserved with strangers.'),
	('Bullmastiff','This nearly square breed should be powerful and active — a combination of strength, endurance and alertness. It should appear to be 60 percent mastiff and 40 percent bulldog. Its gait is smooth and powerful, but its angulation is moderate. Its coat is short and dense, and its expression keen and alert. These attributes allowed the bullmastiff to both overtake and over-power intruders.','The Bullmastiff is innately good-natured, calm, easygoing and surprisingly gentle. It is a well-mannered house pet, but it needs sufficient room to stretch out. This is an extremely loyal breed, and though not excessively demonstrative, it is devoted to its family and good with children.'),
	('Bull Terrier','The Bull Terrier is the cavalier gladiator — a good-looking tough character. It is strongly built and muscular, longer than it is tall. Its muscle mass combined with its relatively low center of gravity make it difficult for opponents to knock it off its feet. Its distinctive head not only shows off its keen and determined expression, but also its great jaw strength. Its gait is smooth and easy. Its skin is tight, and its coat short, flat and harsh.','Exuberant, comical, playful, assertive and very mischievous describes the bull terrier. It is an imaginative breed that often sees things its own way and is stubborn to the end. It needs daily physical and mental exercise lest it exercise its powerful jaws on your home. For all its tough bravado, this is an extremely sweet-natured, affectionate and devoted breed. It can be aggressive with other dogs and small animals.'),
	('Basenji','The Basenji is square-proportioned and high on leg. It is far more slightly built and longer-legged than most other primitive breeds, giving it a good amount of speed and the ability to perform the double-suspension gallop. Its erect ears help it locate prey in thick bush and may act as heat dissipaters. Its short coat also aids in dealing with the hot climate of Africa.','Some consider the basenji to have terrier-like mannerisms because it is feisty for a hound. More often it is considered catlike in mannerisms: clever, inquisitive, stubborn, independent and reserved. Its hunting roots are very evident, as it loves to chase and trail. It needs regular mental and physical stimulation, lest it become frustrated and destructive. Basenjis may be barkless, but they are not mute. They do make a sort of yodel, howl and shriek — and occasionally bark, but just one or two "fox barks" at a time.'),
	('Boykin Spaniel','Boykin Spaniels are medium-sized spaniels, larger and rangier than American Cocker Spaniel but more compact than English Springer Spaniel. The breed’s hallmark is a beautiful solid-brown coat. Colors range from a rich liver to a luscious chocolate. The large, feathery ears hang close to the cheeks, setting off an expression of soulful intelligence. Boykin Spaniels move with the effortless and balanced gait typical of durable gundogs. Bred to work the lakes and swamps of their native South Carolina, web-toed Boykins can swim like seals.','The Boykin Spaniel is an obedient breed that is eager to please. They do require a consistent and firm pack leader, but will train relatively easily. This breed will always be waiting for their next command. The Boykin Spaniel does very well with and enjoys the company of children.'),
	('Brussels Griffon','The Brussels Griffon is square-proportioned, thickset and compact. It has good bone for its size. Its movement is a purposeful trot, with moderate reach and drive. In temperament it is full of self-importance, and its carriage reflects this attitude. Its almost human expression attracts attention and admirers. Its coat can be rough, with hard wiry hair — which is longer around the head — or smooth, with a short glossy coat.','The spunky Brussels griffon is full of itself, brimming with self-confidence and gusto. It is bold, playful, stubborn and mischievous. It is usually good with other dogs and pets. It tends to bark and climb, and some Brussels griffons can be escape artists. This breed makes a saucy companion for a family wanting an entertaining, sensitive pet.'),
	('Bouvier des Flandres','The Bouvier des Flandres is a versatile breed able to perform a variety of functions, including cattle herder, draft dog and guard. As such, it combines great strength with agility and endurance. The bouvier is a compact, short-coupled dog, of square proportion and rugged appearance. Its gait is free, bold and proud. Its weatherproof coat is tousled and double, with a fine undercoat and a harsh, dry outer coat. It is trimmed (if necessary) to a length of about 2.5 inches. The head is accentuated by a beard and moustache, which adds to the dog''s bold and alert expression.','The bouvier is a steady, stalwart companion that is loyal, devoted, fearless and protective. Given daily exercise, it is calm and well-mannered indoors, but ready for an adventure in the great outdoors. It is independent and confident of its own judgment, yet biddable and willing to please. It can be domineering. It is reserved, even protective, toward strangers and can be aggressive with strange dogs. It is very good with children, although it may nip at heels in play.'),
	('Border Terrier','The Border Terrier is of medium bone, slightly taller than long. Its long legs impart the speed, agility and endurance necessary to follow a horse over all sorts of terrain, whereas its fairly narrow body allows it to squeeze through narrow passages in pursuit of a fox. Its gait displays good length of stride. Its coat consists of a short, dense undercoat covered by a very wiry, straight, somewhat broken outer coat, which should conform to the body. Its hide is very thick and loose fitting, affording protection from the bites of its quarry. The border is known for its distinctive otter head, and its alert expression matches its alert demeanor.','One of the few terriers bred to run with the pack, the border is one of the most amiable and tractable of the group. It is inquisitive, busy, friendly and biddable. It does like to hunt and can be independent, ingredients that make for a dog that may tend to roam if given the chance. It is generally good with other dogs and cats, but not with rodents. It is very good with children and makes a good companion for people of all ages. It digs, and some bark. Some are talented escape artists.'),
	('Borzoi','The Borzoi is a running hound capable of hunting large, fierce game in a very cold climate. As such, it retains the greyhound build necessary for running at great speed, but it is larger and stronger than the greyhound. Its jaws should be strong enough to hold down a wolf. The long, silky coat, which can be either flat, wavy or rather curly, provides protection against cold weather and snow. Borzois should possess elegance and grace, with flowing lines, whether standing or moving.','A breed of quiet elegance, the borzoi exemplifies the well-mannered house dog. Outdoors, it races with wild abandon, and it will chase any small animal that runs. It is independent but very sensitive. Although generally good with children, it may not be playful enough to satisfy some children. Some can be timid. It is reserved with strangers.'),
	('Belgian Tervuren','This Belgian Tervuren breed combines elegance and strength. It is square-proportioned and of medium bone. It is noteworthy for its exceedingly proud carriage. Its movement is lively, graceful and seemingly tireless, exhibiting an easy, effortless gait rather than a hard-driving action. It has a natural tendency to move in a circle rather than a straight line. It combines a dense undercoat with an outer coat consisting of abundant guard hairs that are long, well-fitting, straight and of medium harshness. Its expression is intelligent and questioning.','Alert, watchful and energetic, the Tervuren is an active and dependable companion that functions best when given daily mental and physical exercise. It enjoys playing and running outside, and can be a well-mannered companion inside as long as it is given sufficient exercise. It is smart and obedient, but independent. It is aloof with strangers and can be aggressive toward other dogs and animals. It may nip at the heels of children in an attempt to herd them.'),
	('Belgian Sheepdog','The Belgian Sheepdog is an elegant, square-proportioned dog that is alert and agile with proud carriage. Its bone is moderately heavy. As a dog expected to herd for long hours, its gait is smooth, tireless and effortless rather than driving. It has a tendency to move in a circle rather than a straight line. It has an extremely dense undercoat along with an outer coat of abundant guard hairs that are long, well-fitting and straight. Its expression is intelligent and questioning; its black coloration is striking.','The Belgian Shepherd Dog was developed in Belgium as a herding dog to work sheep. He is enthusiastic and remarkably quick. He shows a natural tendency to be in motion. The Belgian was developed for endurance. He must be able to move and tend the flock all day and to guard it from all invaders. In addition to his inborn ability as guardian of the flocks, he is an exceptional watchdog and a tenacious and brave defender of his master and family. He is vigilant, and highly responsive to his owner''s direction. He is alert, intelligent and inquisitive. While he is firmly loyal to those he knows and loves, he typically exhibits reserve with strangers.'),
	('Beauceron','The Beauceron is not a dog of extremes, but is a solid, balanced dog as befitting a true multipurpose dog ready to do a long day''s work. Its body is powerful yet agile, its jaws strong, its gait fluid, effortless, and ground covering. The head is not held high when moving, but is lowered to the level of the back, as is typical of herding dogs. Its outer coat is straight, dense, and coarse, of medium length; this, combined with a dense undercoat, offers weather-resistant protection. An unusual trait is the presence of double dewclaws on the hindlegs, which seem to be a French tradition for herding and flock dogs. Although they serve no function, they were perhaps at one time associated with the best herders, and are now a breed trademark.','Beaucerons are uncannily intelligent and adept at any task involving learning, memory, and reasoning. They are courageous and calm, and make reliable, thoughtful guardians. This is an extremely loyal breed that is eager to please its family; however, if not properly trained, the Beauceron can run the family. Beaucerons are patient with children, but can be overwhelming to them or try to herd them. They may be wary of strangers and do not take to unfamiliar dogs. They can get along with other family dogs and pets.'),
	('Boerboel','The Boerboel is a large dog that is strong, confident and muscular with a distinctive, blocky head. Despite its size, it is the most agile of the mastiff-type breeds. The word Boerboel means "Farm Dog" and it serves as a capable working dog as well as a loyal companion in its home country of South Africa. The skin of a Boerboel should be dark on his stomach and under his fur, as well as the roof of his mouth, which protects against heat and sun. The coat is short, dense coat can be brindle, brown, cream, reddish brown or tawny.','The Boerboel is self assured and fearless. It is highly devoted to family and affectionate with children it knows, but can be aggressive toward strangers. Friends and other pets should be introduced with care, preferably early in the dog’s life. The Boerboel has an unusually high requirement for human companionship—periods of isolation will result in destructive and disobedient behavior.'),
	('Bearded Collie','The Bearded Collie is a medium-sized dog with a long, lean, strongly made body, which gives the impression of both strength and agility. Its gait is supple and powerful, with good reach and drive. The ability to make sharp turns, quick starts and sudden stops is essential in a sheep-herding breed, and the beardie must be able to keep this activity up for a long period of time under all conditions. Its coat is double with a soft, furry undercoat. The outer coat is flat, harsh and fairly straight; it is sufficient to protect the dog but not so much as to obscure the dog''s lines. The beardie''s expression is bright and inquiring.','The boisterous beardie is lively and playful, full of enthusiasm and energy. It is smart and obedient, but it is an independent thinker with a clownish sense of humor. It likes children, but it may be too rambunctious for small children and may try to herd them when playing.'),
	('Black Russian Terrier','The Black Russian Terrier must be strong of body and mind to perform its duties as a reliable guard and military dog. This is a large-boned and well-muscled dog, capable of pulling a heavy load, yet having the agility to traverse rocky terrain or overtake an adversary. The head and neck are powerful. A reliable, intelligent temperament is essential in a dog that also has strong protective instincts; courage is also a must. The weatherproof outercoat repels water while the undercoat insulates the dog from the cold. Length of coat should vary from 1.5 inches to 4 inches with longer coats detracting from the dog''s working ability.','Calm, confident and courageous sums up the Black Russian Terrier. Reserved with strangers, BRTs are very attached to and protective of their family. They are fast learners, but also independent thinkers, and they can be stubborn if pushed to do something they don''t want to do. BRTs are affectionate and social. They tend to stick close to their people, even inside the house. They are gentle and playful with children. They may not be good with strange or dominant dogs, but are fine with other pets and smaller canine housemates.'),
	('Black and Tan Coonhound','The Black and Tan Coonhound moderate build gives it a blend of strength, speed and agility. It is square or slightly longer than tall, with moderate bone. Its long ears may help stir up ground scents. Its deep muzzle allows room for olfactory apparatus. Its deep voice enables the hunter to locate the dog when it has treed its quarry. Its hair is short but dense, providing an all-weather-protective coat. Its expression is alert, friendly and eager. Its stride is easy and graceful, with head and tail held high.','Not the prototypical house dog, the black and tan coonhound, nonetheless, makes an exemplary pet. It is mellow, amiable, calm and unobtrusive indoors. Outdoors, its strong hunting instincts take over, and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to turn from a track after it starts trailing. As befitting a dog with its heritage, the black and tan is strong, independent and stubborn. It is gentle and tolerant with children, but it may be too independent to satisfy a playful child. It is reserved with strangers.'),
	('Bluetick Coonhound','Bluetick Coonhounds are speedy and compact nocturnal hunters named for the mottled (or “ticked”) black-and-blue pattern of the glossy coat. A small female might stand 21 inches at the shoulder and weigh 45 pounds; a large male can top out at 27 inches and 80 pounds. Blueticks are well-muscled but sleek and racy, never chunky or clumsy. The baying, bawling, and chopping bark of Bluetick Coonhounds in hot pursuit might sound cacophonous to some, but to coon hunters it’s the music of the night.','The ideal owner will be happy about spending time with his hound, making sure he gets plenty of activities to keep body and mind healthy and occupied. Athletic and hardy, Blueticks are working dogs that need a job - such as hunting, obedience or agility - to stay happy. Living with a Bluetick can be very rewarding or very frustrating. These hounds are scenthounds, governed by their exceptional noses and prey drive. Plenty of exercise and a job to focus on are essential. Dog sports that Blueticks excel at include tracking, coursing ability test, obedience and agility not to mention night hunts, water races and treeing contests'),
	('Bedlington Terrier','This graceful, lithe dog has a distinctive silhouette. Its arched loin and racy outline give it great speed and agility. A wolf in lamb''s clothing, the Bedlington is unrivaled in its ability to chase and fight agile but tough quarry. Its gait is light and springy. Its coat is a mixture of hard and soft hair standing off the skin, affording good protection as well as outstanding appearance.','The Bedlington is among the softer terriers, not only in looks and feel but in temperament. It is companionable, demonstrative and loyal. It enjoys its creature comforts and is a fairly quiet house dog. Even though it will seldom initiate a fight, it will not allow itself to be intimidated by other dogs and can be a scrappy fighter when pushed. It will give chase to small animals outdoors, but it can usually coexist with them indoors.'),
	('Barbet','The Barbet is a medium-sized, balanced dog, with characteristic thick, woolly, fleecy coat, assuring effective protection against cold and humidity. The length of the body, measured from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttocks, is slightly more than the height at the withers. There is a characteristic beard, which gave the breed its name. The accepted colours of the breed are solid black, brown, fawn, grey, pale fawn, white, or more or less pied. All shades of red-fawn and pale fawn are permitted. The shade should, preferably, be the same as the colour of the body. Grey and white are extremely rare; mixed colours (except with white) are considered a fault. The most common colors are black or brown with white markings. The birth figures worldwide for 2007 are 176. All born were black or brown some with white markings on the chest, chin, and legs.','The Barbet is not aggressive or timid, being docile and very devoted to its master. They are very sociable and fond of the water. The Barbet is essentially a water dog, used for wild fowling. Nevertheless, it has several abilities of a pointer/setter without being a true setter. The breed has no fear of the cold, going into water in all types of weather.'),
	('Briard','The Briard is square or slightly longer than it is tall and powerful without being course; the overall appearance is one of handsome form. Like all good herding dogs, it combines strength, flexibility, agility and endurance with the ability to make abrupt turns, springing starts and sudden stops. Its movement has been described as "quicksilver," with supple, light strides that give the impression of gliding. Its undercoat is fine and tight, and its outer coat is coarse and dry, lying flat in long, slightly wavy locks. On the shoulders, the coat''s length is 6 inches or more. The questioning, confident expression is enhanced by the longer eyebrows, as well as the long-appearing head.','Devoted and faithful, the briard is a loving and protective companion. It is independent, intelligent and self-assured, but it is also willing to please and eager to serve as a partner in adventure. It is reserved with strangers. It can be aggressive with other dogs and may nip at people''s heels when playing. It tends to stay at home and may attempt to keep the family''s children home as well!'),
	('Berger Picard','The Berger Picard is a medium-sized, well-muscled dog, slightly longer than tall, with a distinctive rough coat, erect ears, and a natural tail that normally reaches to the hock and is carried with a slight J-curve at the tip. The Berger Picard should be evaluated as a working sheep-herding dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','The Berger Picard''s attributes include a lively, intelligent personality and a sensitive and assertive disposition that responds quickly to obedience training. By and large, Picards are laid back and mellow but they are known for having a stubborn streak and being reserved towards strangers. They require a lot of socialization during the first two years of their lives. Picards are energetic and hard working, alert and are not excessive barkers. Some Picards are notoriously picky eaters, and it may be difficult to decide on a diet that you and the dog agree on. The breed also has a well-developed sense of humor, making them an endearing companion, and they continue to be used very effectively as both sheep and cattle herder in their native land and elsewhere. Like many herding breeds, Picards require human companionship and lots of it. Since they can be demonstrative to their owners and enthusiastic friends towards other animals, formal obedience training and plenty of positive socialization is a must. Athletic, loyal and filled with a desire to work a long day, the breed excels in any "job" as long as enthusiasm and praise is a part of the task.'),
	('Bergamasco','A sheepdog with a strong work ethic, the Bergamasco''s most unique characteristic is its coat, which contains "dog hair," "goat hair" and "wool" that combine to form black or gray felt-like mats. The mats grow over the course of the dog''s life, reaching the ground at approximately 6 years of age. The coat can actually smell like a sweater when it is wet. But despite its formidable appearance, the Bergamasco is really a trim, athletic sheepdog.','The Bergamasco is an alert, observant and patient dog breed with good self-control and balance. This breed is suited even as a guard and companion dog. The Bergamasco establishes close bond with his owner. Aggressive or overly shy behavior is a fault.'),
	('Bolognese dog','The Bolognese is a small, white, compact dog with a distinctive white single coat. It is of small size, stocky and compact. It is of square build and well-muscled. The head is of medium length. The skull is slightly ovoid. The muzzle is large, black and almost square. It has a developed jaw and the upper lips don’t cover the bottom lips. Its lips are black. It has white, strong and evenly aligned teeth. Its eyes are well developed, open and round. The rims of the eyelids are black and the iris is a dark ochre color. The ears are set high and are long and hanging but rigid at the base. The tail is carried curved over the back. The Bolognese''s height varies 10.5 to 12 inches for a male and 10-11 inches for a female. The weight varies between 4.5 and 9 lbs.','Very serious, generally not very high energy. Enterprising, docile, enjoying his masters, the Bolognese is slightly more reserved and shy than its cousin, the Bichon Frise. Bolognese enjoy companionship of people and form a close relationship with their owners. Vivacious, playful and happy, Bolognese get along very well with other animals. This willing little dog is quite responsive to obedience training. Outdoors he''s rough-and-tumble; indoors he is quiet and happy. They are friendly with strangers. Get them accustomed to people and noises at an early age. Because of this breed’s size, they are prone to Small Dog Syndrome, human induced behaviors where the dog believes he is pack leader to humans. This causes many behavior problems, including separation anxiety and being timid.'),
	('Basset Bleu de Gascogne','The first and immediate impression of a Basset Bleu de Gascogne should be that of a hound with substance and staying power. Rather large, but not too heavy. A Basset (low-slung) hound of superior type, denoting great ancestry, reflecting in both form and action, the extreme physical and hunting characteristics of its ancient stem. Every point of the Basset Bleu de Gascogne is for a purpose relevant to preserving the breed and its uniqueness. Judges are asked to keep this fact in mind when evaluating the merits of an individual hound.','Active, agile and lively with a fine nose and strong hunting ability, excellent in a pack or on his own. Affectionate and happy.'),
	('Basset Fauve de Bretagne','The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a smallish hound, built along the same lines as the Basset Hound, but lighter all through and longer in the leg. Wire-coated, the coat is very harsh to the touch, dense, red-wheaten or fawn. He measures 32 – 38 cm in height and weighs between 36 - 40 lbs but due the old, and no longer permitted, practice of registering mixed litters of Griffon and Basset Fauves sometimes a litter of bassets will produce a long legged dog more akin to the Griffon. They have coarse, dense fur which may require stripping. The hair on the ears is shorter, finer and darker than that on the coat. The ears just reach the end of the nose rather than trailing on the ground and should be pleated. They should have dark eyes and nose and ideally no crook on the front legs. The French standard says these are the shortest backed of all the basset breeds so they generally do not appear as exaggerated as the British Basset.','Smart, courageous and determined, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a serious hunter, easily adapting to different types of game or terrain. It is also an excellent companion, being cheerful, friendly and agreeable.'),
	('Belgian Shepherd Laekenois','The Belgian Shepherd Dog is an elegant, well-proportioned, medium-sized, square dog. By his majestic carriage and harmony of form, the dog of the Belgian Sheepherders gives the impression of elegant robustness. He is a hardy individual, accustomed to living in the open air and built to resist inclement weather and the atmospheric changes so frequent in the Belgian climate. His elegance and expression denote great strength of character, making him a proud representative of the herding breeds.','The Belgian Shepherd Dog was developed in Belgium as a herding dog to work sheep. He is enthusiastic and remarkably quick. He shows a natural tendency to be in motion. The Belgian was developed for endurance. He must be able to move and tend the flock all day and to guard it from all invaders. In addition to his inborn ability as guardian of the flocks, he is an exceptional watchdog and a tenacious and brave defender of his master and family.

While he is firmly loyal to those he knows and loves, he typically exhibits reserve with strangers.'),
	('Black Mouth Cur','The Black Mouth Cur is a powerful, agile tree dog of medium size. The body is square or just slightly longer than tall. Legs are long enough to allow the dog to move quickly and with agility in rough terrain. The head is broad with a moderate stop and a moderately broad muzzle. Ears are set high and drop. The tail is straight, set low, and may be any length. The coat is short and close fitting. The Blackmouth Cur should be evaluated as a working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog''s ability to work. Scars should neither be penalized nor regarded as proof of a dog''s working abilities.','The Black Mouth Cur is a fast, hard hunter that finds game using its eyes, ears and nose. Silent trailers are preferred, although slightly semi-open on a very hot track is allowed. Never open like a hound. A loud, deep chop on bay or tree, ringing cry or slight yodel allowed. Never full-blown bawl mouthed. The Blackmouth Cur combines tenacity and courage with a strong desire to work. They are very loyal and protective of their owner and family.'),
	('Black Norwegian Elkhound','The Black Norwegian Elkhound is a typical Spitz breed with a short compact body, dark eyes, ears standing straight up, and a curly tail carried over the back. It has a rich coat that does not stand out from the body. This is an all-weather hunting dog and the coat is very important. It must be able to keep out the heavy autumn rain in Scandinavia and endure the cold weather, which it does very well.','The Black Norwegian Elkhound is a very robust and hardy dog: very alert and full of power and pride. It is more strong-minded than the Grey Elkhound. The most recommended training method is one that focuses on motivating the dog; such as clicker training or reward-based training methods. Using punishment or dominance-based methods could negatively impact training with the Black Norwegian Elkhound. It is easy to train, but always needs something to do to be happy. It needs continuous exercise and activity in concert with its superb intelligence to do well. It is an excellent hunting dog and loves to be in the forest.'),
	('Blue Lacy','The Blue Lacy is medium in size with a light, balanced yet powerful build. Correct Lacy movement alludes to great speed, strength and dexterity. Its coat is short and sleek. There are three permissible color varieties. Blues are any shade of gray from light silver to dark charcoal. Reds range from light cream to rust. The tri combines these colors with a blue base and distinct red markings as appropriate for trim. White can appear on the chest, stomach and paws. Both the red and tricolored Lacys hold the name Blue Lacy due to the blue-color gene they possess. All Blue Lacys eyes are very bright and distinctive orange to yellow in color, which adds a unique touch to their appearance.','Blue Lacy Dogs in general are intelligent, intense, active, and alert. Developed to be both hunting and herding dogs, they display great drive and determination to work with big game and control difficult livestock. Young dogs may have too much energy and drive for small children. They are easy to train, learning new skills quickly.'),
	('Blue Picardy Spaniel','A Blue Picardy Spaniel on average is around 22–24 inches (56–61 cm) high at the withers and weighs 43–45 pounds (20–20 kg). Its coat is speckled grey black forming a bluish shade, with some black patches. The coat is flat or a little wavy with feathering on the ears, legs, underside and tail. It has long legs with some setter characteristics. It has a long broad nose and muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around the tip of the muzzle. Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the forequarters and the hindquarters are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight. The breed has many similarities with the Picardy Spaniel due to the two breeds'' recent history. The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer, as well as the obvious difference in coat color. The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat, which was brought into the breed by the introduction of English Setter blood. Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards. In addition, the Blue Picardy is a little faster, and has a slightly finer nose.','It is a versatile hunting dog, used for its ability to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy is considered to be a quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is especially good with children.'),
	('Bohemian Shepherd','The Bohemian Shepherd is a medium-sized shepherd, with a length marginally exceeding its height. The dog has long, thick fur and a rich undercoat, allowing him to withstand harsh weather. He has an exceptionally harmonious build. Body is compact and well-proportioned. Typical characteristics for the breed include erect ears, small, pointed and high set. An elegant, long neckline, also marked by long, rich fur. The gait is fluid, light and unhurried.

Some have medium length coats, but most of them have very furry and fluffy coats. It is a medium sized dog—maximum 25 kg in the breeding standard, minimum 16 kg. The only allowed coloring of its long coat is black and tan.','This is an ideal dog for someone who is very active, this breed has lots of energy, is not aggressive, can be easily trained, and is excellent with children and other pets. Its great agility and a keen sense of smell make it a very good rescue dog, a great companion for handicapped people and an outstanding watch dog. This breed has a stable, calm and friendly temperament that allows it to be good with the owner, his family and specially with children.'),
	('Bracco Italiano','The Bracco - or Italian Pointer- should be athletic and powerful in appearance, most resembling a cross between a German Shorthaired Pointer and a Bloodhound, although it is nothing like them in character. It has pendulous upper lips and long ears that create a serious expression. It should be "almost square", meaning that its height at the withers should be almost the same as the length of its body. It should not however be actually square as this would render its famous rear driving push off and front/rear extension to be compromised, thus losing much of its powerful grace. The tail can be docked, mostly due to the strong possibility of injury in rough/dense terrain when hunting, however there has been a sea-change in Italy, with some now working the breed with full tail.','Braccos are very much a people-loving dog and thrive on human companionship, having a strong need to be close to their people. They are a particularly good family dog, and many have a strong love of children. They get along well with other dogs and pets, if trained to do so - it is, afterall, a hunting breed - and must be taught what to chase and what not to. They are very willing to please as long as they have decided that your idea is better than theirs. Obedience training is a must for a Bracco, and the more is asked of them, the better they do. Harsh reprimands do not work with this breed unless the reprimand is a fair one - and harshness must occasionally be used with some dogs to remind them who is actually in charge. Although not an aggressive breed, many Braccos will alert if there is a reason, and some will bark or growl if there''s a good reason. The breed loves to hunt, and they excel at it - in fact, a non-hunting Bracco is not a happy Bracco, and will act out in various other ways. Hunting without a gun (as in NAVHDA - this group does not even allow a handler to carry a gun during trials) is an area in which the Bracco can excel and this can be a great opportunity for training the dog to connect with the owner. They are an active breed, but require more mental exercise than physical exercise to keep them happy. A Bracco owner can teach games like hide-and-seek (an object or person) which fits into the breed''s original and current usage, and keeps them mentally active.'),
	('Braque du Bourbonnais','Rounded in every direction, with lateral sides rounded, with parietal bones and zygomatic arches well developed.

The most numerous populations of working purebred livestock guarding Karakachan dogs are found in Bulgaria and the United States. The Karakachan was officially approved as a Bulgarian old native breed in 2005. The Karakachan dog may be a descendant of ancient Balkan domestic dogs, possibly since the time of the Thracians.

The characteristic straight angulation of the hind legs produces a short, stilted gait unique to the breed.

It moves easily, tending to roll slightly because of its wide body and short legs. The expression is soft.','Among the most low-keyed and easygoing of sporting breeds, the clumber spaniel is nonetheless a hunter at heart, ever ready for a day in the field. At home it tends to be quiet and may even need to be goaded into exercise. It is one of the few sporting breeds suitable for city life, although it will relish walks and outings.

	('Chinook','At a glance you know Chinooks weren’t built for lying on the sofa watching General Hospital with Grandma. These tawny-coated, no-frills workers are muscular and substantial, with males standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder. Females, with their distinctly feminine look, are a bit smaller. Chinooks were conceived as dual-purpose haulers, with the power of freighting dogs and the speed of sled racers. They’re the picture of stouthearted dignity, with a kindly twinkle in their dark almond eyes.','It’s amazing that dogs this smart and lovable were once on the verge of extinction. Happily, the Chinook was brought back from near oblivion by devotees who cherished the breed’s many virtues. They’re calm, people-oriented dogs with a special feel for children. Chinooks are trainable, eager workers who aim to please. Sledding, carting, obedience, agility, search-and-rescue work, and herding are a few pursuits they’ve mastered.

	('Cesky Terrier','If the Cesky Terrier (pronounce it “chess-kee,” meaning Czech) looks something like a cross between a Scottie and a Sealyham, it’s because that’s basically what it is. Ceskys are muscular, short-legged, and handsome hunters standing no taller than 13 inches at the shoulder. They come in several shades of gray, including a stunning platinum. Wavy facial hair gives Ceskys a sporty, Continental look, and the medium-long neck lends a dash of elegance to these game, unspoiled working terriers.','They are loyal family members who require continued socialization throughout their lives due to their reservednature towards strangers. Weighing in at 16 to 22 pounds, they are a comfortable size for most households and require a minimum amount of daily exercise. They are an active breed and like most terriers, love to dig. A secure backyard where the breed can get regular exercise is strongly recommended. Other exercise outlets include events like tracking, agility, earth dog and obedience.'),
	('Cockapoo','The Cockapoo is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Cocker Spaniel and the Poodle. The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses. Note: some Cockapoo clubs are working toward making the Cockapoo a purebred dog by multi-generation crossing, while other breeders are sticking to the basic Poodle / Cocker mix, stating they wish to preserve the heterosis effect in the hybrid mix. Ask the breeder you contact which type of Cockapoo they are breeding.','Cockapoos have become popular because they generally combine the outgoing, loving personality of the Cocker Spaniel with the low-shedding, low-dander qualities of the Poodle. Cockapoos are active, and thrive when they receive regular exercise. Cockapoos can be very agile, excelling at "retrieve" games and enjoying activities such as swimming. Cockapoos are frequently very needy dogs and as such are not suitable to be left alone for long periods as they frequently suffer from separation distress or anxiety. The Cockapoo is a cross-breed, not a purebred, and does not "breed true." In breeders'' terms, "breeding true" means that the pups will have consistently predictable characteristics. Cockapoos, however, may inherit the characteristics of either or both their parent breeds. While some Cockapoos appear more similar to Cocker Spaniels, others will exhibit more Poodle traits, creating a variation in Cockapoo appearance and temperament.'),

During the winter the breed is thickly clothed with a dense, double coat that allows them to easily withstand the rigors of the high Arctic. Females have a shorter coat and are significantly smaller than the males.','The temperament of the breed should reflect the hard working animal that it is. In general disposition, the mature Canadian Eskimo Dog is usually gentle and affectionate, exhibiting quiet friendliness or harmless curiosity, or being somewhat distant. They are very pack oriented, and if raised as a group the pack structure will be well controlled by dominant individuals. Compared to modern domestic breeds, the Canadian Eskimo Dog seems to be over stimulated by things such as food, work, fighting or play, and for this reason they should be the companions of adults, not a child’s pet.'),
	('Carolina Dog','The Carolina Dog is a dog of medium build, possessing the general appearance of a small jackal or wolf in combination with many features of a small Sighthound.

The dog typically has a medium-length straight back, with a distinctive waist which sets off a deep brisket from a highly tucked-up loin. The tail is distinctive in both its fish-hook-like configuration and its variable carriage, depending on mood. The medium to large, usually upright ears and long, graceful neck are also distinctive and suggest the appearance of a small, versatile and resourceful predator, well adapted to surviving on its own in a natural habitat. In ideal conditions, a Carolina Dog should appear thin and tight. It is not inappropriate, for example, for the ribs to show slightly as in a well-conditioned racing sighthound. Individuals that are greatly overweight should be severely penalized. The dog is to be shown in a natural condition, with little or no evidence of grooming or scissoring. Whiskers are not to be removed.','Carolina Dogs are natural runners. They have excellent noses that help them hunt wild animals, when in the wild.

Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses. The Catahoula Bulldog has tight skin and a very short, smooth coat. In most cases the Catahoula does not have an undercoat but may develop one if it is living in a seasonal or colder climate. Ears come in rose type or button over and are sometimes cropped for a noble look. Eye color can come in brown, ice blue, gold, emerald green or a combination of all of these.

The Catahoula is well muscled and powerful, but not bulky, giving the impression of agility and endurance. The Catahoula is a moderate breed and should not resemble either a sighthound or a bulldog in appearance. The body is just slightly longer than tall and the distance from the elbow to the ground should equal 50-60 percent of the dog’s height from the withers to the ground. Because of the breed’s name, many people assume that all Catahoulas have the so-called “leopard” markings and blue eyes. In fact, the breed is noted for its many and unusual coat colors and patterns, as well as varied eye color. The Catahoula should be evaluated as a multi-purpose working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','Catahoulas are highly intelligent and energetic. They are assertive but not aggressive by nature. Catahoulas in general are very even tempered. Males tend to be more obnoxious than females, but Catahoulas are very serious about their job if they are working dogs. They make a good family dog but will not tolerate being isolated, so interaction with the dog is a daily requirement. When a Catahoula is raised with children, the dog believes that it is his or her responsibility to look after and protect those children. Many owners will say that the Catahoula owns them and they can be insistent when it''s time to eat or do other activities. Catahoulas are protective and a natural alarm dog.

Caucasian Ovcharka have keen senses, so they are very alert and good trackers. Any change in their surroundings can result in warning barks and growls, particularly at night. The breed is slow to mature and headstrong. Socialization and patient training techniques can be used to temper the Caucasian Ovcharka’s characteristic suspicion and aggressiveness toward strange people and dogs, resulting in a mature dog with good judgment. This breed is hardy and able to adapt to a wide range of climates.'),
	('Central Asian Ovtcharka','The Central Asian Shepherd Dog is a dog of great size with massive bone structure and powerful muscles. The body is slightly longer than tall. The head is massive.

The height at the withers in both sexes is between 16 and 21 inches and the length exceeds the height by approximately 10%. Nowadays, some dogs are even taller; that is probably due to better nutrition and an easier life - they grow to their full genetic potential. Traditionally the tail is docked very short but, if undocked, it is carried curled over the dog''s back.','The Croatian Sheepdog is an alert, agile, keen and intelligent dog with enormous energy and a strong need for human leadership. It is healthy, resistant to disease and inexpensive to keep. It possesses a well-developed herding instinct and is an excellent watchdog. An instinctive herder, it is wary of strangers. If socialized early, however, it responds well to obedience training. As a pet without early obedience training and exercise to occupy its athletic body and excellent mind, it can become very noisy, even destructive.'),

The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog develops a very strong social relationship - not only with their owner, but with the whole family. It can easily learn to live with other domestic animals which belong to the family; however, difficulties can occur in encounters with strange animals. It is vital to subdue the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog''s passion for hunting when they are puppies to avoid aggressive behavior towards smaller animals as an adult. The puppy should never be isolated in the kennel; it must be socialized and get used to different surroundings.

They are elegant, graceful and courageous. Its physical strength couples with great speed and plenty of stamina to allow it to catch and kill several types of game, from hare to blackbuck, over rough country. It is not an ideal dog for the apartment dweller, as it needs a great deal of space and exercise; although if arrangements are made to exercise the dog regularly in a sufficiently large, safely fenced area, it may do well in a flat or any other dwelling. The breed, if treated with kindness and respect, can be exceptionally loyal. They are not very friendly, and do not like to be touched by strangers. However, a Caravan should never be aggressive, as this sort of temperament is not ideal for a hunting dog, which must tolerate other dogs and human beings, especially when they are not intruding on his territory. It makes a reasonable watch dog, and can protect that which he holds dear, should the need arise. He should always be treated in a kind, consistent, fair, and respectful manner, otherwise he may develop a nervous or vicious nature—either of which are difficult to live with.'),

The Drever is a steady worker that hunts hare, fox, and occasionally deer; but this dog has the courage to pit himself against even a wild boar. In such cases, he circles and dodges the prey, warning the hunter by barking furiously. The Drever has an excellent nose and a musical voice which is much larger than his size would seem to warrant. The Drever was bred to be tenacious on the hunt and therefore it is very important that the owners of this breed are just as stern when dealing with him in order to show him where his place is among his human pack. Owners who are determined and consistent with the rules, displaying a natural firm but not harsh authority over the dog will bring out the best in this breed.

The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses.'),
	('English Springer Spaniel','The English Springer Spaniel is compactly built, upstanding with proud carriage, slightly longer than tall but with fairly long legs and a deep body. Its build should suggest a combination of strength, agility and endurance, a dog capable of hunting tirelessly under the most difficult of conditions. The outer coat is of medium length, either flat or wavy, and the undercoat is soft and dense. This combination protects the dog from weather, water and thorns. The gait is long and ground-covering. The expression — alert, kindly and trusting — is an essential feature of springer type.','Friendly, affectionate and easily trained. These qualities are essential when being trained for the field or shown in the ring. The Springer’s long ears, soft expression and happy disposition clearly show him to be a member of the ancient family of spaniels. It is uncharacteristic for a gun dog to be aggressive towards other dogs or people, therefore aggression is unacceptable behavior. Tentativeness is to be equally penalized with allowances for young puppies.'),
	('English Cocker Spaniel','The English Cocker Spaniel must be able to find, flush and retrieve upland game birds for a full day of hunting. It must be small enough to penetrate dense cover, but of sufficient size to retrieve larger game. The broad muzzle helps when retrieving. The dog is slightly taller than long, compactly built and short coupled. This breed loves to hunt and shows it by the wagging of its tail when on the job. The English cocker has a driving, powerful gait that covers ground effortlessly. The coat is of medium length, silky in texture and either flat or slightly wavy. The feathering should not be so profuse that it becomes a hindrance in the field, but it should be long enough to protect the underside of the dog. The expression is soft and melting, yet dignified.','The English Cocker Spaniel is merry, affectionate and even-tempered. They are easily-trained, are willing workers and excellent companions. They exhibit enthusiasm in the field, accompanied by an incessant action of the tail. Dogs exhibiting sluggish or hyper-active temperaments are to be faulted. They exhibit balance, both in motion and while standing. The head is especially characteristic of the breed, having a brainy appearance indicating high intelligence. The muzzle is also distinctive. The whole is always to be of primary consideration rather than any of the parts. Exaggeration of any of the parts is to be faulted.'),
	('English Setter','The English Setter is an elegant and athletic hunting dog with the ability to run tirelessly at a good pace. Its trot is ground-covering and effortless, with the head held proudly and a lively tail. The coat is flat, with feathering on the ears, underside, backs of legs, underside of thighs, and tail. Its markings are distinctive, consisting of flecks of color, sometimes with patches, on a white background. The combination of good looks and hunting ability make the English setter a perfect gentleman''s hunting companion. The Laveracks tend to be larger, carry more feathering, often have deeper muzzles and usually hold their tails nearly level when on point. The Llewellins tend to be smaller and faster, with less coat and often larger patches of color. They tend to hold their tails straight up when on point.','Bred to cover a lot of area when hunting, the English Setter is a lively dog that loves to hunt and run. This is especially true of dogs from field lines. If not given sufficient exercise, they can be overly lively inside. With daily exertion, however, they are calm and tractable house dogs. Those from conformation lines are particularly laid-back and gentle and excel with children and less active adults. This is an amiable, easygoing breed that gets along well with children, strangers and other dogs.'),
	('English Toy Spaniel','Cobby, compact and essentially square in shape, the English Toy Spaniel is sturdy of frame and solidly constructed, with a silky, flowing coat. Its moderately rounded head, lustrous dark eyes and well-cushioned, fairly short-nosed face exemplify the important characteristics of the English Toy Spaniel. Absolute soundness and proper muscle tone is a must. Head properties should remain free of exaggeration so as to not compromise breathing and/or obstruct normal vision.','The King Charles is a friendly breed, to the extent that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living. The breed can tolerate other pets well, although the King Charles still has the hunting instincts of its ancestors and may not always be friendly towards smaller animals. It is intelligent enough to be used for obedience work and, due to its stable temperament, it can be a successful therapy dog for hospitals and nursing homes.'),
	('Entlebucher Mountain Dog','Swiss herders developed four breeds of mountain dog known for their striking tricolor coats. Of these, the Entlebucher (ENT-leh-boo-cur) Mountain Dog is the smallest and quickest. They’re muscular, long-backed cattle dogs with short, sturdy legs. They stand from 16 to 21 inches at the shoulder, with females at the lower end of the scale. Their dark eyes draw you into an attentive, friendly face. Bred to move cattle up and down sloping pastures, Entles are famous for agility, balance, and rugged determination.','They may be reserved with strangers. Entles are an active, high energy and physical breed, with above average exercise requirements, so they are not a dog for the casual owner. Entlebuchers do best when they have a job. Although the Entlebucher loves and is devoted to children, his shepherding instincts can make integrating small children and a puppy a bit tricky. The Young Entle can become possessive and begin to consider children to be “his own” to herd and watch over. Being exceptionally strong for his size, the Entle can easily overwhelm a child. Very careful consideration should be taken when considering adding this breed to a family with small children.'),
	('English Foxhound','The breed standards'' guidelines for showing English Foxhounds requires them to be 21–25 inches (53–64 cm) tall at the withers. The skull is wide and the muzzle is long. The legs are muscular, straight-boned, and the paws are rounded, almost cat-like. The English Foxhound comes in any hound color, most often tricolor, tan, red, or black with a white base.','Traditionally a pack hound, the English foxhound nonetheless makes a stately house dog, as long as it has human or canine companionship. It gets along well with horses, dogs, children and other pets. It is an avid sniffer and trailer, however, and needs daily exercise in a safe area. It is a tolerant, amiable and gentle dog, even though it is not very demonstrative. Most are reserved with strangers. It is not well-suited for city life. It bays.'),
	('East-European Shepherd','Their backs are straight, strong, wide, and long. They are 10-17% longer than their height at withers. The loins are long and wide, well-muscled and slightly arched. Their croup is wide, long, and slightly sloping towards the tail. The tail is long, bears thick fir, erected in a form of a sword when the dog''s excited. The chest is moderately wide, while the belly is reasonably tucked up. The chests are scimitar in form, reaching the hocks or slightly longer in some cases. The legs are strong and straight; feet are oval and compact. The dog''s pace is of a trotter, rather than of a skid, sliding just above the ground so typical to other German Shepherds'' cousins.','The East European Shepherd is balanced, confident and intelligent. VEO is an attentive, active, self-assured dog that appears calm and quiet but constantly monitors situation and is ready to "turn on" on owner''s command. The East European Shepherd has an active defensive reaction, distrusts strangers and can be aggressive when needed but under no circumstances it should be inclined to unmotivated aggression. VEOs excel as K9 and personal protection guard dogs or as companions. East European Shepherds are working dogs and need a regular exercise. They were bred for their intelligence and they are curious and quick learners. Their ability to withstand extreme climates allows them to live outside, as well as inside, in a house or an apartment. They perform well as hunting dogs and can work as draught dogs in a group of the same.'),
	('English Shepherd','English Shepherds are similar in appearance to Border Collies and Australian Shepherds. English Shepherds usually have tails and a less rounded head than many Aussies. English Shepherds are never merle as Aussies frequently are. They are generally not square in body like an Aussie. English Shepherds tend to be larger than Border Collies but are most readily distinguished from Border Collies by their very different upright, loose-eyed herding style. The coat is medium length and can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is frequently feathering on the legs and tail, as well as on the ear. As a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed quite a lot and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting. The primary coat colors are: sable and white (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and black and tan. Other variations such as solid dogs of any color, piebalds, and red nosed tricolors and sables also exist but are not common.','The English Shepherd temperament is the defining characteristic of the breed, with high intelligence and often a unique type of kindness for those in his home, both animals and people. The English Shepherd is often an independent worker. English Shepherds are adaptable and learn routines quickly. Some can be watchful of strangers and are more one-person dogs. However, once he accepts people or children or stock as his own, there are few better caretakers than an English Shepherd. The English Shepherd frequently exhibits an independent, bossy or "enforcer of the rules" streak in his temperament. If the dog''s desire to enforce order is not channeled and directed to a suitable end by a strong, confident leader, he may exhibit many undesirable behaviors. Nevertheless, English shepherds can thrive as companion dogs in environments that provide sufficient mental and physical stimulation.'),
	('Eurasier','The Eurasier is a balanced, well-constructed, medium-sized Spitz (Spitzen) type dog with prick ears. It comes in different colors: fawn, red, wolf-grey, solid black, and black and tan. All color combinations are allowed, except for pure white, white patches, and liver color. Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards call for the Eurasier to have a thick undercoat and medium-long, loosely lying guard hair all over the body, with a short coat on the muzzle, face, ears, and front legs. The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the Eurasier''s neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue.','Eurasiers are calm, even-tempered dogs. They are watchful and alert, yet reserved towards strangers without being timid or aggressive. Eurasiers form a strong link to their families. For the full development of these qualities, the Eurasier needs constant close contact with its family, combined with understanding, yet consistent, training. They are extremely sensitive to harsh words or discipline and respond best to soft reprimand. The Eurasier is a combination of the best qualities of the Chow Chow, the Keeshond, and the Samoyed (dog), resulting in a dignified, intelligent breed. Eurasiers were bred as companion dogs; as such they do poorly in a kennel environment such as those commonly used for institutionally trained service dogs, nor are they well suited for the social stresses of working as a sled or guard dog. Training should always be done through family members, not through strangers or handlers. Eurasiers should never be restricted to only a yard, kennel, crate, or chained up. They would pine and become depressed. Within these limitations, Eurasiers can work very well as therapy dogs. This breed enjoys all kinds of activities, especially if the activities involve their family. Eurasiers are calm and quiet indoors, outdoors they are lively and enjoy action. Eurasiers rarely bark but if they do, they usually have a good reason.'),
	('East Siberian Laika','Males are 55 to 66 centimetres (22 to 26 in), while females are on the smaller side at 51 to 60 centimetres (20 to 24 in). Black and tan, with light patches (called karamis), grizzle, patched, ticked, white, grey, black, red and brown of all shades. There are two major types, the Evenki and the Irkutsk; other less important types are the Yakutia, Amur and Tofolar. These types vary in color and physique, as the ESL is still more of a diverse conglomerate breed than the other three Russian Laika breeds. Physically the ESL is somewhat rangy, nearly square in proportion, slightly higher at the withers than at the croup, robust in bone; head shape varies with the regional varieties. Ears are erect and triangular, the tail carried in a curve over the back. The coat is a medium long double coat with straight coarse guard hair and a soft thick undercoat.','Highly aggressive towards large predators, they are calm and well-tempered with people, although they can be good watchdogs and if encouraged will be protective against human intruders. Generally, they seem to be good companion dogs and can also be trained in obedience.'),
	('French Bulldog','The Frenchie shares many of the traits that made its bulldog ancestors so successful in the bull-baiting arena: low center of gravity, wide body, heavy bone, muscular build and large, square head. It has soft loose skin forming wrinkles about the head and shoulders. Unlike the bulldog, it has an alert, curious expression, which is aided by its bar ears. Also, unlike the bulldog, its movement is unrestrained and free, with reach and drive. It is a hardy, entertaining home companion and a solid lap dog.','The French bulldog is a clown in a lap dog. It enjoys playing and entertaining its family, as well as cuddling and snoozing with its favorite person. It is amiable, sweet, companionable and willing to please.'),
	('Flat-Coated Retriever','"Power without lumber and raciness without weediness" is the traditional description of the flat-coated retriever. It is strong but elegant, never cobby, among the most streamlined of the retrievers. It is slightly longer than tall, of moderate substance. The head is distinctive, long and of "one piece," all parts flowing smoothly into each other. The gait is ground-covering, smooth and efficient. The coat is thick and flat, of only moderate length, providing protection without adding weight. These attributes have resulted in a versatile and athletic hunter capable of retrieving over land and water.','The Flat-Coated Retriever is a sweet, exuberant, lively dog that loves to play and retrieve. It is on the go outdoors, but quiet indoors. This breed is among the most devoted and companionable of dogs, a true family dog. It needs regular exercise to be on its best behavior, however. It is a sensitive breed and very responsive to training. Its hallmark is its wagging tail.'),
	('Field Spaniel','Somewhat longer than tall, solidly built with moderate bone, the field spaniel is a dog without exaggeration, a combination of beauty and utility. Its stride is long and low, with head held proudly and alertly and the tail wagging but not carried high. The field spaniel is built for both activity and stamina, enabling it to hunt in dense cover or water. It has a single coat, which is flat or slightly wavy and moderately long, giving it protection from thorns and water. The expression is grave and gentle.','The Field Spaniel is happiest when it has a job to do. Although independent in nature, it is devoted, sensitive and willing to please. Always cheerful and affectionate, it is an excellent family companion as long as it is given regular exercise. The field spaniel is especially known for its tractable nature. It is typical for a field spaniel to be somewhat reserved with strangers.'),
	('Finnish Lapphund','Finnish Lapphunds, with their luscious coat, sweet spitz-like face, and profusely coated tail curving over the back, are instantly recognizable as Nordic dogs. Built for hard work in frigid temperatures north of the Arctic Circle, Lappies stand about 20 inches at the shoulder and are surprisingly powerful for their size, with well-developed muscles and substantial bone beneath a double coat that comes in many colors and patterns. Lappies are agile dogs of effortless movement, capable going from a trot to full gallop in a second flat.','Few Lappies today in America have seen a reindeer, but they adapt well to other kinds of work, including obedience, agility, tracking therapy, and herding other types of livestock. When working, Finnish Lapphunds are agile, alert and noisy. While interacting with people, however, the breed is calm, friendly, and very submissive. Lappy puppies are adorable, but new owners should take care to remember that a small puppy grows up quickly and needs to learn good habits early on. Socialization, puppy classes and basic training will help him learn those habits.'),
	('Finnish Spitz','The Finnish Spitz has a foxlike appearance, incorporating the typical traits of a Northern breed: small erect ears, dense double coat and curled tail. It is square-proportioned, and without exaggeration, quick and light on its feet. It has the conformation and temperament to hunt actively and tirelessly under the coldest of conditions. Its double coat, consisting of a short soft undercoat and harsh straight outer coat about 1 to 2 inches long, provides insulation from the snow and cold, allowing it to hunt tirelessly under the coldest of conditions.','Like most spitz breeds, the Finkie is independent and somewhat stubborn, although it is more hunting oriented than other spitz breeds. It is alert, inquisitive and playful, but it is also sensitive, tending to be devoted to one person. It is a breed conscious of its place in the dominance hierarchy, and some males can try to be domineering. It is good with children, and generally good with other pets, but it can be aggressive to strange dogs. It is reserved, even aloof or suspicious, with strangers. In keeping with its barking heritage, the Finkie is proud of its barking ability and likes to show it off — loudly!'),
	('Fila Brasileiro','Though large in size, the Fila does not appear static. Rather it is harmonious, cat-like and above all powerful. The expression is noble, solemn, dignified but somewhat melancholic. The Fila Brasileiro appears self-assured and calm but is never absent in expression. When at attention, the gaze of the Fila Brasileiro is firm, alert and unwavering. Another typical characteristic of the breed is its gait, which is similar to that of a camel, moving two legs of one side at a time. The gait gives it a typical rolling lateral movement on the throat and the hindquarters which is accentuated when the dog''s tail is raised. The head is typically lower than the backline. The characteristic carriage and gait has earned it great success in dog shows.','The Brazilian Mastiffs are known to be naturally protective. It is also known for its extreme wariness of strangers and agility when protecting or defending its master. The dedication and obedience of the Fila Brasileiro has found its way into Brazilian saying "As faithful as a Fila". The Fila Brasileiro temperament is what characterizes the dog. The Portuguese word for their temperament is Ojeriza, which directly translated into English means dislike and distrust. The socialization period (about the first year with the first 6-8 months being the most important) of the dog''s life is crucial to the temperament of the individual dog. If the pup is exposed to a lot of people in a positive manner (known as ''socializing''), the pup (keeping in mind the dog''s natural protective instincts) can be encouraged to behave in a calm manner in public, but emphasis should be placed on the fact that socialization is done differently from other breeds. Despite extensive socialization, the fila is instinctively protective and will naturally guard and protect its owner, their family members and the family pets; this is not something that needs to be trained, it is an innate trait. Strangers should not be left unattended with a Fila and, like all other guardian breeds, it may not be the best choice for those who have frequent visitors to their homes. Lack of all socialization with strangers at a young age will result in a dog which is very anti-social.'),
	('French Spaniel','The French Spaniel is one of the two tallest spaniel breeds, being taller than the English Springer Spaniel. Males can range in height from 22–24 inches (56–61 cm), and females are about an inch shorter. Dogs can range in weight from 45–60 pounds (20–27 kg). A normal dog has a muscular appearance with a deep chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel''s coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver.','The French Spaniel has a friendly and outgoing personality and is well balanced and patient. It is not a naturally aggressive dog, is eager to please and thus can be trained easily. A dog of this breed will form a strong bond with its master, being typically a working dog. It has a high level of stamina and requires vigorous exercise.'),
	('Finnish Hound','The Finnish Hound is a tri colored, medium sized, short coated hound that is strongly built but not heavy. Males and females should have distinctly marked sex characteristics.','Friendly, calm and never aggressive, yet energetic in the hunt, the Finnish Hound is used as a hunting dog for hare and fox by following the scent. Eager to hunt in difficult circumstances. He works independently, is a versatile tracker and pursues the quarry with passionate barking. Make sure you are this dog’s calm, but firm, confident pack leader to prevent behavior issues. Proper human to canine communication is essential.'),
	('Francais Blanc et Noir','The Francais Blanc et Noir is a typical hunting pack hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, slightly domed head, long drop ears, and slightly square flews that just overlap the lower lip. Size is 65 to 72 cm (25.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females slightly smaller. The colour of the coat is white and black, with a black mantle, sometimes speckled or ticked with black or blue. Pale tan dots are above each eye as well as tan on the cheeks, below the eyes and ears, and below the tail. Sometimes a tan marking is found on the base of the upper thigh, which is called the ''roe buck mark''. Faults are listed as deviations in appearance that have an effect on the health and working ability of the dog, as well as indication of crossing with Foxhounds or being off-colour, indicating that a dog with such faults should not be bred.','The breed is noted for its perseverance on the hunt as well as a good nose and voice. Unusual for pack dogs, it is friendly and easy for humans to manage.'),
	('German Shepherd','The German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs, well-balanced, muscular dog, slightly longer than tall, with a medium length coat, erect ears, and a low-set natural tail that normally reaches to the hock and is carried in a slight curve like a saber. The outline of the German Shepherd Dog is made up of smooth curves rather than angles. The head is in proportion to the size of the body, strong without appearing coarse or fine. Gender differences are readily apparent. The German Shepherd Dog should be evaluated as an all-around working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','The German Shepherd Dog is confident and fearless, willing to be approached, yet a certain level of aloofness towards strangers is acceptable. When working, the German Shepherd is alert and eager, adapting well to new tasks. Lack of confidence is a serious defect in the character of a German Shepherd. The structure of this breed was designed for efficient locomotion, particularly at the trot, so poor movement is another serious fault.'),
	('Golden Retriever','The Golden Retriever is a medium-sized to large, well-balanced dog with a distinctive golden-colored coat; small, drop ears; and a natural tail carried level with the back or with a slight upward curve. The correct relationship of length of body to height is 12:11. The Golden Retriever is a dog without exaggeration. The Golden Retriever should be evaluated as a working gun dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','The breed’s most readily identifiable characteristic is its rich, lustrous golden color. Another essential characteristic is proper temperament. A Golden Retriever is friendly, calm, compliant and compatible with people and other dogs. Goldens are particularly good with children. The Golden Retriever’s friendly temperament is reflected in his kindly expression. The Golden Retriever is a powerfully built dog, with a good nose for tracking, a soft mouth, and an eagerness to learn.'),
	('German Shorthaired Pointer','The German Shorthaired Pointer is an all-purpose close-working gun dog that combines agility, power and endurance. It is square or slightly longer than tall; although it has a short back, it should stand over plenty of ground. It should have a clean-cut head, graceful outline, strong quarters and an athletic physique. The gait is smooth, light and ground-covering. The coat is short and tough.','The German shorthaired pointer''s idea of heaven is a day hunting in the field and an evening curled up by its owner''s side. This is an active dog that can become frustrated and "creative" if not given ample daily exercise, both mental and physical. It is a devoted family pet, although at times it is overly boisterous for small children. Because part of its heritage includes hunting mammals, some can be aggressive to small pets unless raised with them. It is a sensitive breed, responsive to gentle training. Some can whine or bark a lot.'),
	('Great Dane','This regal breed combines great size and power with elegance. It is square-proportioned and well-balanced. Its gait is strong and powerful with long, easy strides. These attributes are necessary in a dog required to overtake and then over-power relatively swift but formidable quarry. Its coat is short, thick and glossy. The Great Dane is most noteworthy for its majestic carriage and appearance — the "Apollo of Dogs."','The Great Dane is gentle, loving, easygoing and sensitive. It is generally good with children (although its friendly overtures may overwhelm a small child) and usually friendly toward other dogs and pets. It is powerful but sensitive and responsive to training. It makes a pleasant, well-mannered family companion.'),
	('German Wirehaired Pointer','The German Wirehaired Pointer is a sturdily built hunter, the German wirehaired pointer should be able to hunt all day through all types of cover. It is slightly longer than it is tall, enabling the gait to be free and smooth. The weather-resistant, straight wiry coat is an essential breed characteristic. The outer coat is about 1 to 2 inches long, long enough to protect against brambles but not so long that the outline of the dog is obscured. The eyebrows, beard and whiskers are of medium length. The undercoat is thick in winter for warmth but thin in summer.','The German Wirehaired Pointer is both a rugged bird dog and amiable companion. It has the energy to hunt for hours, so it must be given a daily outlet lest it becomes destructive. It is a responsive breed, although it tends to be stubborn. It retains a guarding instinct, so it is often aloof, even protective, toward strangers as well as strange dogs. It is generally good, if sometimes overly boisterous, with children. It is ideal for the outdoor-oriented person wanting a tireless, weather-proof, intelligent partner.'),
	('Giant Schnauzer','The Giant Schnauzer is a larger, more powerful version of the standard schnauzer. Its body is strong, compact and nearly square, combining great power with agility. Its stride is free and vigorous, with good reach and drive. Its double coat consists of a soft undercoat and a harsh, wiry, dense outer coat — a combination that enables it to withstand harsh, alpine conditions. Its hallmark harsh beard and eyebrows, coupled with its smart outline, make for a striking figure. The combination of rugged build, reliable temperament and weather-resistant coat make for a powerful and versatile worker.','The playful, rambunctious giant schnauzer may be too boisterous for small children, even though it is otherwise very good with children in its own family. It is bold and protective of its family and reserved with strangers. It may be aggressive toward other dogs. This intelligent and exuberant breed is a good choice for an active person wanting a partner in adventure, although at times the giant may try to be the leader.'),
	('Great Pyrenees','Elegant, imposing and majestic, the Great Pyrenees is a large to giant dog of medium substance that is slightly longer than tall. Its thick coat gives the impression of heavier bone and stature. This breed was developed to guard flocks on steep mountain slopes and so must combine strength with agility. It moves smoothly, with good reach and drive. Its weather-resistant double coat consists of a dense, wooly undercoat and a long, flat, coarse outer coat, imparting great insulation from the Pyrenean cold. Its expression is elegant and contemplative.','The Great Pyrenees is a capable and imposing guardian, devoted to its family and somewhat wary of strangers — human or canine. When not provoked, it is calm, well-mannered and somewhat serious. It is very gentle with its family and children. It has an independent, somewhat stubborn, nature and may try to dominate a less secure owner. Some are not good off leash and may wander away. The Great Pyrenees tends to bark a lot.'),
	('Greater Swiss Mountain Dog','The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a strong draft breed. It is large and powerful, slightly longer than tall. Its movement displays good reach and drive.

It is calm and easygoing, very gentle with children as well as other pets. It is territorial, alert, bold and vigilant.'),
	('Gordon Setter','The heaviest of the setters, the Gordon Setter is sturdily built with plenty of substance and bone. The suggestion should be one of strength and stamina rather than speed. It is square-proportioned, upstanding and stylish. The gait is bold, smooth and effortless, with head carried proudly and tail constantly flagging. The Gordon setter carries a thicker coat than the other setters. The hair is straight or slightly wavy, always soft and shiny. Longer feathering is on the ears, underside, backs of legs, and tail. The whole impression should be of a rugged dog capable of withstanding a long, active day in the field under a variety of conditions.','The Gordon Setter is a capable, close-working bird dog. It can run and hunt all day, and this kind of energy needs a regular outlet or the dog is apt to become frustrated. Gordons make lively, enthusiastic companions and need the company of lively people. Somewhat more protective than the other setters, they are reserved toward strangers and sometimes aggressive toward strange dogs. The Gordon has earned its reputation as a devoted family dog.'),
	('German Pinscher','The German Pinscher is a medium-sized dog with a muscular, square build. It is light enough to be extremely agile and solid enough to be strong. It can hunt all day, aided by extremely sensitive senses. If it turns up a rodent, it can catch and dispatch it. If it turns up an unwelcome human, it can sound the alert and adamantly encourage the person to leave. The German Pinscher has found a new niche as a companion and watchdog of ideal size and loyal temperament.','Vivacious, tenacious, and courageous, the German Pinscher is a lively self-appointed property patroller. Ever watchful, the German Pinscher does not bark frivolously, but does sound the alert to intruders. A quick learner, the German Pinscher is nonetheless not inclined to obey unless there''s a good reason to do so. The breed is playful and affectionate, and good with considerate children. It can be wary of strangers. German Pinschers may argue over which of them gets to be boss, and they may not be good with small pets -- especially rodents!'),
	('Greyhound','The ultimate running dog, the Greyhound is built for speed. Its long legs and arched back enable it to contract and stretch maximally while executing the double-suspension gallop. It has tremendous muscle mass and light legs, further enhancing speed. The feet are long and narrow, giving maximum leverage. The long tail serves as a rudder and brake when running at high speed. The coat is short and smooth. Two types of greyhounds are available: AKC (show) and NGA (racing). Retired NGA greyhounds are smaller, sturdier and faster than show dogs and may be more inclined to chase small animals.','Known as "the world''s fastest couch potato," the Greyhound is quiet, calm and extremely well-mannered indoors. They are good with other dogs, and with other pets if raised with them; outdoors, they tend to chase any small thing that moves. They are reserved with strangers, very sensitive and sometimes timid. Despite their independent nature, they are eager to please.'),
	('Glen of Imaal Terrier','Longer than tall, the Glen of Imaal Terrier short, bowed front legs, well-muscled loin, rising topline and strong rear allow it to dig and then get adequate leverage to back out of a hole dragging a struggling badger that might weigh more than the Glen itself. The medium-length outercoat is harsh with a soft undercoat, and is less prone to mat or catch burrs than a longer, softer coat. The strong tail provides a sturdy handle for pulling the Glen from a hole. Unlike most terriers, barking while working is discouraged. This is a working terrier that has not sacrificed form for fashion.','A big dog on short legs, the Glen is a dog of big ideas that''s never short of ways to achieve them. This is a spirited, inquisitive, courageous breed, always ready for a game or a hunt. Less excitable than most terriers, it is nonetheless an active dog. However, once given its daily dose of activity, it is content to snuggle by your side. At home the Glen is good-natured and gentle with family members; with its childlike exuberance, it especially enjoys the companionship of children. Some Glens can be dog aggressive. Glens learn quickly but may not always do what you ask. They are not inclined to bark much.'),
	('Grand Basset Griffon Vendeen','Grand Basset Griffon Vendéens a long-backed, short legged hunting breed of dog of the hound type, originating in the Vendée region of France. They are still used today to hunt boar, deer, and to track rabbit and hare, but are more commonly kept as a domestic pet. They are pack dogs, so owners should either spend a lot of time with them or get a second dog or cat. They have a happy and confident personality, which can sometimes manifest itself as disobedience, but they are great companions.','The UK Kennel Club conducted a health survey of Basset Griffon Vendéens (Petit and Grand varieties combined) in 2004. This is apparently the only completed health survey (as of July 16, 2007) that might include Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen, but it is unclear what proportion of dogs in the survey were Grand Basset Griffon Vendéens instead of the more common Petit.'),
	('Goldendoodle','The Goldendoodle is a cross between a Golden Retriever and a Standard Poodle (or Miniature). At their best, they are intelligent, friendly, and affectionate. They come in three sizes: miniature (weighing 15 to 30 pounds), medium (30 to 45 pounds), and standard (45 to more than 100 pounds). Because they are a cross breed, their traits are not fixed, so there is not a guarantee that the Goldendoodle puppy you purchase will fall into the desired weight range.','The Goldendoodle is intelligent, friendly, and family oriented. It is a highly social dog. Goldendoodles tend to follow their nose wherever it leads, so a fenced-in yard is recommended. They are always ready for a game; most Goldendoodles retain the natural retrieving instincts of the Golden Retriever. The Goldendoodle’s friendliness with strangers makes it a poor watchdog. Goldendoodles do not bark frequently.'),
	('German Longhaired Pointer','The German Longhaired Pointer should be muscular, elegant, and athletic. It should not be bulky or cumbersome, and it should be able to move with great speed and freedom. It has moderate bone, but has substance, and must never look frail or weak. Like all German pointers, they have webbed feet. Watch out for aggression in puppy years.','GLPs are a kind, gentle, friendly, and intelligent breed. They are very affectionate, and may experience separation anxiety. They only make good pets when properly exercised, as they need a "job" to do, and do not adapt well to a sedentary life. The GLP is an excellent family pet, as it enjoys playing with children. It is very sociable with dogs.'),
	('Greenland Dog','The Greenland Dog is a powerful, heavy-built dog. It has a broad, wedge-shaped head, slightly tilted eyes and small, triangular ears covered with thick fur that prevents frostbite. It has strong, muscular, short-haired legs. The tail is usually rolled along/across its back. When it lies down and curls up to rest, the tail often covers the nose. Its coat is of medium length and consists of two layers. The inner layer consists of short wool-like fur, the outer layer of longer, coarser, water-repellent fur.','The predominant temperament qualities of the Greenland Dog are energy, mental strength and boldness. He is a tireless sled dog and while friendly to people, he is not particularly attached to any one person and not suitable as a guard dog. The breed has a strong instinct for hunting polar bear and seal.'),
	('Griffon bleu de Gascogne','The Griffon bleu de Gascogne is a medium sized, solidly built Griffon of rustic appearance. Height at the withers for males is 19.5 to 22.5 inches. For females, it is 19 to 21.5 inches.','Alert, keen and enterprising, the Griffon Blue de Gascogne has a fine nose and a good voice and is an intent hunter, yet it is affectionate.'),
	('Grand Bleu de Gascogne','The coat and expression combine to form an incomparable group. Its color, build and head combine to form an impression that is very noble and very French. The first and immediate impression of a Grand Bleu de Gascogne should be that of a hound with substance and staying power. Considering the breed''s long hunting history, individual hounds should have moderate bone and ample muscle. Males are heavier than females. Defects such as bull necks, out at the elbow, loaded shoulders, or a "beef steer" profile, should not be confused with masculinity. Likewise, defects such as a shallow muzzle, poorly formed chest, extremely narrow pelvic region and general frailty should not be confused with femininity.','A trail hound of moderate speed, which at creation was used to hunt wolves but since the demise of the wolf, has since successfully adapted to hunting wild boar, deer, fox and hare. The Grand Bleu de Gascogne hunts in a leisurely, methodical manner and possesses, in the extreme, a great amount of determination, tremendous endurance, desire, self confidence, sagacity, remarkable scenting ability, a deep, powerful melodious voice, a distinct coat color and an aristocratic form. Of even temperament, essentially friendly. Some individuals may be very outgoing, while others are somewhat reserved in nature, but never shy or vicious. As a hunting/working Scenthound breed, and being called upon to work in close proximity with other hounds and their handlers, aggression towards other hounds and people is to be considered a fault. Extreme shyness or viciousness is a disqualification.'),
	('Havanese','The Havanese is a small, sturdy, short-legged dog. Its unique gait is exceptionally lively and springy, accentuating the dog''s happy nature. The coat is double, with both under and outer coat soft. The profuse outer coat is very long, reaching 6 to 8 inches in length, and ranges from straight to curly, with wavy preferred. The curly coat is allowed to cord. The expression is gentle.','Havanese have a quiet and gentle disposition, but enjoy rowdy play sessions. They are affectionate, preferring to be at their owner''s side or in the same room, and will alert their owner to approaching strangers. They enjoy the company of other Havanese. They are intelligent, easy to train and attentive to their handler. Havanese have an alert, gentle expression produced by the combination of large dark eyes, dropped ears, long fur and an endearing habit of tilting their head when listening.'),
	('Harrier','The Harrier is a smaller version of the English foxhound, more suited for hunting hares. It has large bone for its size, and is slightly longer than tall. It is a scenting pack hound and should be capable of running with other dogs, scenting its quarry and hunting tirelessly over any terrain for long periods. It has a gentle expression when relaxed and alert when aroused. The coat is short and hard.','The Harrier is somewhat more playful and outgoing than the foxhound, but not as much as the beagle. It is amiable, tolerant and good with children. Its first love is for the hunt, and it loves to sniff and trail. It needs daily exercise in a safe area. Most are reserved with strangers. It tends to bay.'),
	('Hokkaido Dog','The Hokkaido is a medium sized, spitz type breed that has strongly developed secondary sex characteristics. It is well balanced, sturdily built and strongly boned. The breed is capable of withstanding severe cold and heavy snowfall. Its tough, clean cut muscles give it great stamina.','The breed is known for fidelity to its owner, bravery, and the ability to withstand the cold, among other traits. It has an innate sense of direction and smell, and can therefore return to its master no matter how great the distance. Temperament will vary depending on the lineage and region of upbringing. They are good with children if they are raised with them from puppyhood and/or properly socialized. Children should be taught how to display leadership skills, and the dog should be taught to respect the child.'),
	('Hovawart','The Hovawart is a medium to large size German dog breed. The breed is very versatile, being useful as a watch, guard, tracking and rescue dog, as well as making an excellent companion. The males are larger and more massive than the females.','The Hovawart is an outstanding watch dog and somewhat reserved towards strangers. They make excellent family dogs as they are totally devoted to their family. They are a working dog breed, and require a consistent and loving yet strict training and meaningful activity throughout their lives.'),
	('Hamilton Hound','Rectangular, well proportioned, giving impression of great strength and stamina. Tricoloured.','Hamilton Hounds are very easy going, but can be stubborn. They are very patient with children. This breed makes a fantastic hunter as it has a very high prey drive, so caution needs to be taken with small animals. Owners must provide plenty of daily exercise, and be the dog''s firm, but calm, confident, consistent pack leader to avoid behavior issues.'),
	('Italian Greyhound','Essentially a slender miniature greyhound, the Italian greyhound is exceptionally elegant and graceful. It embodies the same qualities that enable the full-sized greyhound to run at top speed using the double-suspension gallop: a curvaceous outline with a slight arch over the loin and good rear angulation. Its gait is high-stepping and free. The coat is short and glossy, like satin.','A sighthound in a small package, the Italian greyhound shares its larger relatives'' characteristics. It loves to run and chase. It is extremely gentle and sensitive. Reserved, often timid, with strangers, it is devoted to its family and is good with children, and other dogs and pets. However, it can be easily injured by boisterous children and larger dogs.'),
	('Irish Wolfhound','The tallest of the sighthounds, the Irish wolfhound resembles a rough-coated greyhound, although of more powerful build. Great size is especially valued in the breed. This combination of speed, power and size enables the Irish wolfhound to run down and overpower large prey. Despite its size, the breed should be gracefully built, its gait easy and active, and its head held proudly. The rough coat, which provides protection against the cold and damp, as well as its opponents'' teeth, is especially wiry and long over the eyes and under the jaw.','Aptly known as the gentle giant, the Irish wolfhound is a soft-natured, easygoing breed. It is calm around the house, sensitive, patient, easygoing and sweet. Despite its great size, it is good with children, pets and other dogs. It is reserved with strangers and courageous when the need arises.'),
	('Irish Setter','Among the most breathtaking of dogs, the Irish setter''s beauty is in part the result of necessity. Its elegant, yet substantial build enables it to hunt with speed and stamina. Its build is slightly longer than tall, giving ample room for movement without interference between fore and hind legs. The trot is ground-covering and efficient. The coat is flat, straight and of moderate length, with longer feathering on ears, backs of legs, belly, chest and tail, providing protection from briars without becoming entangled in them. The rich mahogany color is just beautiful.','The Irish setter was bred to be a tireless and enthusiastic hunter, and it approaches everything in life with a rollicking, good-natured attitude, full of gusto and fervor. Given a daily outlet for its energy, it makes a pleasant companion. Without ample exercise, it can be overly active inside or become frustrated. It is an amiable breed, eager to please and be part of its family''s activities. It is good with children, but can be too rambunctious for small children. It is less popular as a hunter than the other setters.'),
	('Irish Terrier','The Irish Terrier has a graceful, racy outline, with a moderately long body. It should not have the short back characteristic of so many of the long legged terriers. It is sturdy and strong in substance, but it is also active and lithe in movement. This is an all-round terrier that must combine speed, endurance, agility and power to perform a great variety of jobs. Its broken coat is dense and wiry, never so long as to obscure the body shape. Its expression, like its nature, is intense.','Called the daredevil of dogdom, the Irish terrier is brash, bold, assertive, playful, inquisitive, independent, strong-willed and ever ready for action and adventure. It is usually aggressive toward other dogs and small animals and tends to be reserved with strangers. It likes to chase and run and hunt and explore; it needs daily physical and mental exercise in a safe area. Given sufficient exercise, it is surprisingly well-mannered and dignified indoors. It is a loyal and entertaining companion.'),
	('Icelandic Sheepdog','The Icelandic Sheepdog is a slightly under medium-sized Spitz type dog, with a triangle-shaped head, prick ears, and a thick double coat. Seen from the side, the dog is rectangular. The length of body from point of shoulder to point of buttocks is greater than the height measured at the withers. The depth of chest is equal to the length of the foreleg. The tail is carried in a loose curl over the back. There are two types of coat, long and short, and both are thick and extremely weatherproof. There is a marked difference in appearances between the sexes. The Icelandic Sheepdog should be evaluated as a herding and drover dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','Icelandic Sheepdogs are tough and energetic. Hardy and agile, they are extremely useful for herding and driving livestock or finding lost sheep. However, the dogs are not known for hunting. They are very alert and always give visitors an enthusiastic welcome, without being aggressive. Friendly and cheerful, the Icelandic Sheepdog is inquisitive, playful, and unafraid. They generally get along well with children, as well as other pets.'),
	('Irish Red and White Setter','Sportsmen thrill at the sight of a noble Irish Red and White Setter frozen on point, motionless as a statue. These medium-to-large bird dogs are powerful, solid, and sinewy, with enough stamina and bird sense to get the job done any day of the week and twice on Sunday. The stunning coat—vivid red “islands” floating on a sea of pearl white—has a practical function: It enables hunters to spot their dog at a distance. The handsome face projects a keen but kindly expression.','The Irish Red and White setter can be the most devoted and affectionate of dogs making them ideal all-round family dogs. They are extremely intelligent and respond well to proper training but they do need to have plenty to occupy them. They thrive best in active families, where they have outlets for their high energy, and require space to run freely. Young puppies do not require much exercise but once they reach maturity the breed''s working instincts mean they require enough space to be able to run hard and fast for a long distance. Setters are usually good natured, very gentle and get on well with children and other dogs.'),
	('Ibizan Hound','The Ibizan Hound should possess deer-like elegance and expression, and its movement should reflect these qualities. Its lithe build enables it to perform the double-suspension gallop with great speed, agility and endurance. It is a superb jumper, able to spring to great heights from a standstill. It is racy, slightly longer than tall. With the exception of its large ears, it should not be exaggerated in any way. The trot is light and graceful. The coat can be hard, either short or wire — the latter should be from 1 to 3 inches in length.','The graceful Ibizan hound retains great hunting instinct, using its acute senses of hearing and smell to locate small animals, and relishing the opportunity to chase anything that moves. Unlike most sighthounds, it barks when chasing. It is reserved with strangers; some can be timid. It is gentle, mild-mannered, even-tempered and loyal, and makes a quiet, trustworthy house pet.'),
	('Irish Water Spaniel','The Irish Water Spaniel is built like no other spaniel, being much taller and racier. The body is of medium length, the whole dog being slightly rectangular in appearance. The general appearance suggests both dash and endurance. The gait is smooth and ground-covering. The coat is one of the breed''s distinctive features. The body is covered with a double coat consisting of crisp ringlets. This combination imparts water, weather and thorn resistance to the dog, enabling it to hunt in the harshest of conditions. The Irish water spaniel''s expression says it all: alert, intelligent and quizzical.','Like most dogs of the American Kennel Club Sporting group, the Irish Water Spaniel is essentially an active, willing and energetic companion. Because it has been bred from stock used to fetch game and return it to hand without a fuss, it has the natural instinct of wanting to please. Its keen sense of working as a team makes it a relatively easy dog to train and discipline. Because of its great intelligence and quizzical nature, it has the reputation of being the clown of the spaniel family and will do ordinary things in extraordinary ways to achieve that which is asked of it. Some individual dogs can be very wary of strangers and not every IWS can be trusted to get along with other pets. Early socialisation and training is a must.'),
	('Jack Russell Terrier','The Russell Terrier is a strong, hardy, earth-working Terrier. He is full of life and moves with confidence that matches his keen expression. The breed''s handy size, small flexible chest, nose, strong voice and fearless nature make it an excellent specimen to work vermin below ground. Its weatherproof coat may be smooth, broken or rough and is predominantly white with tan and/or black markings.','The Jack Russell Terrier is a bold, friendly, active and alert hunting terrier, built for work underground. This breed is notoriously fearless and requires little encouragement to go to ground. Aggression towards anything other than legitimate quarry detracts from the dog’s ability as a working terrier, and should be discouraged as much as possible. This is a high-energy breed and is happiest in an environment where there is lots of regular activity.'),
	('Japanese Chin','Small, lively and aristocratic, the Japanese Chin is a square-proportioned small dog. It has a bright, inquisitive expression — distinctly Oriental. A small amount of white shows in the inner corners of the eyes, imparting a look of astonishment. Its gait is stylish, lively and light. The single coat is abundant, straight and silky, tending to stand out from the body. The overall appearance is one of Oriental aristocracy.','The Japanese Chin is a devoted companion, relishing a warm lap as much as a boisterous game. It is sensitive and willing to please, tending to shadow its owner. It is a friend to all: strangers, dogs and pets. Its playfulness and gentleness make it a good child''s companion for equally gentle children. The breed has been described as almost catlike — some even climb.'),
	('Japanese Spitz','The Japanese Spitz is a small dog, around 33 cm (13 ins) at the withers, with a somewhat square body, deep chest, and a very thick, pure white double coat. The coat consists of an outer coat that stands off from the soft inner coat, with fur shorter on the muzzle and ears as well as the fronts of the forelegs and the hindlegs. A ruff of longer fur is around the dog''s neck. It has a pointed muzzle and small, triangular shape prick ears (ears that stand up.) The tail is long, heavily covered with long fur, and is carried curled over and lying on the dog''s back. The white coat contrasts with the black pads and nails of the feet, the black nose, and the dark eyes. The large oval (akin to a ginkgo seed) eyes are dark and slightly slanted with white eyelashes, and the nose and lips and eye rims are black. The face of the Japanese Spitz is wedge-shaped. They share a common resemblance with the white Pomeranian dog, Samoyed and American Eskimo Dog.','Active, loyal, and bright, the Japanese Spitz are known for their great courage, affection and devotion making them great watchdogs and ideal companions for older people and small children. Most Japanese Spitz are good watch dogs, despite their relatively small size, and they have a tendency to bark to warn of arriving strangers. The Japanese Spitz is first and foremost a companion dog and thrives on human contact and attention, preferring to be a member of the family. They are known as very loyal dogs. They enjoy being active and love to be in the outdoors. They are intelligent, playful, alert, and obedient, and particularly excellent and loving toward children. Unlike many other dogs, the Japanese Spitz will customarily have his or her tail flipped onto its back. In some cases this is thought to be dominant behaviour, but in the Japanese Spitz case this is normal bearing.'),
	('Jagdterrier','The Jagdterrier is first and foremost a hunting and sporting dog. Jagdterriers possess a spirit of liveliness and speed at work, yet are regal at rest. "Alert," "athletic" and "active" describes the ambience of the Jagdterrier. A bit of fire is always evident in its expression. Physically, individuals should exhibit a square (though not broad) build, standing squarely and true over the feet. A deep and narrow chest allows the dog to easily enter dens. Leg length is in proportion to the rest of the body, avoiding both stubbiness or legginess. The tail is set fairly high and straight, and is gaily carried. The tail posture, while the dog is working, will be wayward and is not important. Though cropped, the remaining tail must be long enough to serve as a handle, should the hunter need to pull the terrier from a den. The coat may be either harsh or smooth; the important factor for coats of working terriers being that the coat must be thick and ample for turning briars and fangs.','This terrier breed is a clever hunter, unrelenting, tough, and robust. The Jagdterrier is unafraid of the most formidable wild game and very intent in the pursuit of such game. The breed is highly intelligent and affable with its master and other hunters. Considering its determination to work, and its combustible energy, the breed should not be selected strictly as a pet, though they are totally people friendly. Dash, gameness and pluck are all descriptive of a properly bred Jagdterrier. The Jagdterrier, bred solely by hunters over its existence, has maintained the fearless characteristics of early day den terriers.'),
	('Japanese Terrier','The Japanese Terrier is a short coated, small sized, clean cut dog, with a smart appearance and a compact outline.','The Japanese Terrier is a cheerful, animated, intelligent dog. They are gentle and sometimes cautious but, like other terriers, they can be intense when chasing squirrels (which may be bigger than they are).'),
	('Jämthund','The Swedish Elkhound is a large, rectangular spitz breed, clean cut, strong, substantial and agile. It must not give the impression of having a long body or of being overly heavy in body, as it is a breed known for great endurance. Courageous and energetic, but also stoically calm.','As with most breeds developed for hunting, the Swedish Elkhound requires a lot of regular exercise to stay fit, both physically and mentally. It quickly becomes bored if kept indoors for too long and can become destructive.'),
	('Keeshond','The Keeshond is a square-proportioned, sturdy dog of Northern type. It is an all-purpose dog, a generalist rather than a specialist, and its build reflects this. The gait of the keeshond is distinctive: clean, bold and brisk, with only slight to moderate reach and drive. It has a long straight harsh outer coat standing off from its body, a good mane and a thick downy undercoat — all imparting superb insulation from cold and damp.','The keeshond combines many traits of the best house dogs: fairly energetic and playful, very attentive and loving, and ready for adventure yet content to take it easy. It is sensitive and learns readily. It makes a good companion for a child or adult. It is friendly to all but, nonetheless, an alert watchdog.'),
	('Kerry Blue Terrier','This versatile breed has the build of a dog able to perform a variety of tasks, all requiring athletic ability. It can run, herd, trail, retrieve, swim and dispatch vermin — the ideal all-around farm companion. In keeping with this, it is not exaggerated in build. It is an upstanding, long-legged terrier with a short back, displaying strong bones and muscle. Its coat is soft, dense, and wavy, and of a distinctive blue-gray color.','The Kerry Blue Terrier is a versatile terrier, the Kerry blue''s personality is multifaceted. It can guard, hunt, herd or just be a fun-loving companion. It needs daily mental and physical activity in a safe area. It loves to run, chase, hunt, explore, play and dig. Indoors, it is well-mannered. It can be protective toward strangers yet greet verified friends with great enthusiasm. It is apt to be aggressive toward other dogs and small animals. It is clever and independent, often stubborn. Some tend to bark.'),
	('Kooikerhondje','The Kooikerhondje is a small, flashy, orange and white spaniel-like sporting dog. Originally bred in Holland as a duck decoy dog, its heavily white plumed tail waves jauntily to entice and lure ducks to follow it into Eendenkooi (duck cages). When not working the traps, Kooikers were expected to work on the farm to catch vermin. The preferred height at the withers is 15 to 17 inches for males and 14 to 16 inches for females. The proportion of the Kooiker is off-square. The bone and substance of the Kooiker is moderate. The head should be in proportion to the dog. The expression is gentle and alert. Ears should be red in color and well feathered and ideally adorned with earrings. The color for the Kooiker should be predominately orange-red and may be patched or solid on pure white although a few small spots on the legs are acceptable. A black tail ring where the color changes from orange-red to white is permitted.','Cheerful, good natured, friendly, quiet, well-behaved, and alert; those are terms that are used to describe the Kooikerhondje. Depending on its domestic environment, it is kind, happy and lively. They are also intelligent, attentive and more than willing to please their owner. The Kooikerhondje adapts to situations rather quickly, changing his behavior from quiet to lively when the situation allows him to be. He will not always immediately like strangers, instead choosing to retreat. But once he warms up to someone, the trust will be there for the rest of his life. The Kooikerhondje can make a fine apartment dog if exercised regularly, but a fenced yard will be more ideal. He has a medium energy level, yet is usually quiet when indoors.'),
	('Kuvasz','The Kuvasz is a giant dog, slightly longer than tall, and medium-boned. It is not bulky, but instead light-footed, with a free, easy gait. The breed''s combination of power and agility stems from its versatile roots as a guardian, hunter and herder. Its double coat is medium-coarse, ranging from wavy to straight.','Despite its sweet looks, the kuvasz is a tough protector, fearlessly defending its family or home. It is gentle with and protective of children in its own family, but it may misinterpret a child''s rough-and-tumble games with other children as attacks on its child. It is reserved with strangers and may be aggressive toward strange dogs; however, it tends to be very gentle with other pets and livestock. It is devoted and loyal but not very demonstrative. Some can be domineering.'),
	('Komondor','The Komondor is a large, muscular dog, with plenty of bone and substance; it is slightly longer than tall. Its gait is light and leisurely, with long strides. Its hallmark coat is double, consisting of a dense wooly undercoat and a coarser outer coat that is wavy or curly. The undercoat is trapped in the outer coat so that it forms strong, felty, tassel-like cords. This coat helped protect the dog from the elements as well as the teeth of tough adversaries. It also helped the dog to blend in with its flock.','The Komondor, being naturally wary of strangers, makes an excellent house guard dog. They are devoted to their master and will defend him against attack by any stranger. This trait makes it advisable that the dog only be used as a herd/flock guardian/protector, not for driving. When mature, the breed is an earnest, courageous, very faithful herd/flock guardian. While a puppy, the Komondor is playful.'),
	('Korean Jindo','The Korean Jindo is a medium-sized, sturdily-built, Spitz-type dog with a triangular shaped head, prick ears, and a harsh, straight coat of medium length. The body is either square or slightly longer than tall. The tail is thick and may be loosely rolled over the back or carried over the back in a sickle position. Gender differences in this breed are very apparent. Typically, males are larger with heavier heads while females have more fox-like heads. The appearance of the Jindo gives the impression of intelligence, strength, and agility.','The Jindo is an enthusiastic hunter, able to follow cold trails of rabbit, raccoon, and badger. In packs, Jindo can hunt even wild boars and roe deer. Jindos are renowned for their loyalty to family members and their attachment to their home. Jindos have often been known to travel long distances to return to their original owner. The Jindo has a fastidious nature and puppies are housebroken with little training. Jindos also keep their coats extremely clean. Jindos are, by nature, watchful of other dogs and may, on their own territory, react aggressively to intruding dogs. Jindos are highly intelligent but because of their independent nature, respond best to positive reinforcement training, and preferably from their owner. While the Jindo is devoted to its owner, they are aloof and suspicious toward strangers.'),
	('Karelian Bear Dog','The Karelian Bear Dog is a medium-sized, sturdily-built, Spitz-type dog, with a triangular-shaped head, prick ears, and a harsh, straight, black or black and white coat that is of medium length. The length of body, from point of buttocks to point of sternum, is just slightly longer than the height, measured at the withers. Slightly longer coat on the thighs may make the length of body appear greater. The tail is carried in a loose curl over the back, although a natural bob or stub tail is acceptable. Honorable scars or other evidences of injury resulting from working in the field are not to be penalized.','The Karelian Bear Dog has a reserved but stable temperament and is very devoted to its master. Karelians have strong hunting instincts. They are normally aggressive with other dogs, particularly in their own territory, so they do not work well in a pack. They are fearless and self confident, and will attack bear and other large game without hesitation. Their senses, particularly the sense of smell, are very keen. They are never aggressive towards people.'),
	('Kishu Ken','The Kishu Ken is a medium-sized sturdy dog. The coarse double coat is short and straight with a thick, soft undercoat. Coat color mostly comes in white, but occasionally brindle, sesame or red do occur. The nose is usually black, but can be brownish or pink. Has a scissor or level bite. Has a broad head with prick ears inclined forward that are on the smaller side. Tail curls over the back. There is fringing on the tail and cheeks. It has a close resemblance to the Shiba Inu, Akita Inu and Ainu Dog.','Kishu Kens are a one person/one family dog. They are courageous and brave as hunters, and will be loyal to their owners. They have a strong prey drive, and will hunt small animals. A few have been known to do well with cats if raised with them. They do well with other dogs if socialized well as puppies, however, due to their pack instincts they might cause some fights for dominance. They are quite headstrong and willful, making training necessary, but they are devoted and loyal to family, getting along well with children, if raised with them. Kishu Kens like to keep an eye on whatever is going on, and sometimes find a high place to look out from. They can be aloof or shy around strangers. They are easily housebroken, intelligent, and strong willed.'),
	('Koolie','The Koolie is as diverse as the country it originates from, Australia. In the north of Queensland and New South Wales they are tall, medium boned and agile, bred for mustering Simmental cattle and Brahma over many miles. In The Hunter Valley region and Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, they''re thicker set and shorter to flush low lying cattle from the dense bush and gullies. In Victoria, one finds the smallest variety of the Koolie. Koolies are bred to meet the needs of the stockman, grazier and farmer, all agile, all with the same ability to adapt to any situation, all with a strong willingness drive. The Koolie vary from 40 to 60 centimetres (16 to 24 in) in size and are a contrast of coat, colour and body type, although they are merled coat pattern. The solid red or black Koolie are often mistaken for Kelpies, and some bi coloured Koolie have been taken for Border Collies by the general public, rarely if ever by breeders. As all of these breeds share Collie ancestry, they resemble each other.','Graziers, stockmen and dairy farmers across Australia since days long past have typically selected breeds which display the abilities required to meet their working needs. The temperament found in a Koolie is a culmination of these much sought-after abilities. The optimal worker possesses a combination of working skills and bonding temperament. Owners will be rewarded through the Koolie''s diligence in varied roles such as in work situations, sporting activities, loyal service or the time honoured role of companionship. Known to be patient, temperate, dedicated, with a strong sense of willingness and devotion; the Koolie is not naturally aggressive but can demonstrate dominance. They show an untiring enthusiasm for work and an admirable hardiness when the job or circumstance requires.'),
	('Kromfohrlander','The Kromfohrländer comes in 2 coat variations: wirehaired (Rauhaar) and smooth haired (Glatthaar). The distinction is the presence of a beard on the wirehaired variety and a rather long coat on the smooth haired variety. Therefore the wirehaired resembles a terrier, while the smooth haired looks rather like a spaniel. The color is brown/tan/buff markings on a white background with a blaze on the face ''as symmetrical as possible.''','The Kromfohrländer is a very lively, good-natured, intelligent breed with a comparatively weak hunting instinct, loves to play and run and can adapt to many situations fairly well. Kromfohrländers are very much "people dogs" and they rarely stray very far from their owner. They take to strangers and children rather hesitantly at first, but once they get familiar, they are friends for life.'),
	('Kangal Dog','The Kangal Dog is a large, powerful, heavy-boned dog, whose size and proportions have developed naturally as a result of its continued use in Turkey as a guardian against predators. The head is large and moderately wide with drop ears. A properly proportioned Kangal Dog is slightly longer (measured from prosternum to point of buttocks) than tall (measured from the withers to the ground), and length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) should equal slightly more than one-half of the dog’s height. The tail, which is typically curled, completes the distinctive silhouette. The Kangal Dog has a double coat that is moderately short and quite dense. The Kangal Dog has a black mask and black velvety ears that contrast with a whole body color which may range from light dun to gray. Honorable scars or other evidences of injury resulting from working in the field are not to be penalized.','The Kangal dog is calm, controlled, independent, powerful and protective. They may be aloof towards strangers, but a well-socialized Kangal Dog is friendly with visitors and especially children. They must never be shy or vicious. A well-trained Kangal is sensitive and alert to changing situations, responding to threats with judicious warnings and courageous action if necessary. They make good guardians of livestock and humans alike, but they may not be suitable for inexperienced dog owners, as the independent intelligence of the Kangal makes for a difficult pupil.'),
	('King Shepherd','The King Shepherd is a large breed. According to the American Rare Breeds Association males stand at over 29 inches (74 cm) tall and should have an ideal weight of 130 to 150 pounds (59 to 68 kg) pounds while females are 27 inches (69 cm) tall and ideally 90 to 110 pounds (41 to 50 kg).

	('Kyi-Leo','The Kyi-Leo reaches 8-12 inches in height and 9-14 pounds in weight. It has a long silky coat, most commonly black and white but sometimes gold and white, which tends to grow to long lengths (never quite reaching past the floor) if tended properly. Its hair also grows on its face and tail. It has small yet delicate legs that are prone to damage if dropped, but the Kyi-Leo can be very agile and quick. The Kyi-Leo has notable similarities, in body size, shape, and hair, to the Shih Tzu dog breed though the eyes are more human set rather than bulging and they do not have the short-snout face.','The Kyi-Leo is generally calm, obedient, quiet, and difficult to provoke. It is usually very playful and active around trusted humans or animals, but tends to stay cautious and alert around strangers. Its acute hearing makes it a decent watchdog. It ideally lives in indoor settings and can be very patient when left alone for long hours at a time.'),
	('Karst Shepherd','The Karst Shepherd is a medium sized, compact sheepdog, of iron-grey color with a 10 cm long dense, double coat.

Some of the darker animals have characteristic stripes on the legs, a reminder of their ancestry.','The breed standard describes the dog as having a sharp temperament and strong individuality, distrustful of strangers. It''s a good guard dog. Like all large dogs, the Karst Shepherd needs to be well socialized while very young, with people if the dog is to be a companion, and with livestock if the dog is to be a guardian. If the breed''s background is taken into consideration, and if the dog is well socialized and trained, he may make a good family dog. Temperament of individual dogs may vary.'),
	('Labrador Retriever','The Labrador Retriever is a medium to large-sized, short-coupled, powerfully-built dog with a short, dense, water-resistant coat; small, drop ears; and a short, thick otter-like tail carried level with the back or with a slight upward curve. The length of body is equal to or only slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the distance from the elbows to the ground is equal to one-half the height at the withers. Balance, outline, intelligence, temperament and movement are of overriding importance. The Labrador Retriever is a breed of moderation, thoroughly sound, and willing and able to do its work. The Labrador Retriever is a dog without exaggeration, so light, weedy dogs; long, low-stationed dogs; and cloddy, lumbering dogs are to be equally penalized. The Labrador Retriever should be evaluated as a working gun dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','The Labrador Retriever is an enthusiastic hunter with a good nose and a soft mouth. They excel in all performance activities. Another essential characteristic of the Labrador Retriever is the short, dense, double coat that protects the dog when retrieving from water.

They are extremely intelligent and easily trained to perform a variety of complex tasks.'),
	('Lhasa Apso','The Lhasa Apso is longer than it is tall, with a strong loin. Although the breed has never been used for purposes requiring great athleticism, it should nonetheless have a strong loin and well-developed quarters and thighs. The head is well-covered with a good fall over the eyes and good whiskers and beard, imparting a dignified, almost lionlike look. The bite should be either level or slightly undershot. The coat is heavy, straight, long and hard.','Despite its lap-dog appearance, the Lhasa is a tough character. It is independent, stubborn and bold. Although it is eager for a romp or game, it will be happy as long as it is given exercise. It will also happily snooze beside its owner. These characteristics make it an excellent small companion in adventure. It is somewhat reserved with strangers.'),
	('Lagotto Romagnolo','The appearance of the Lagotto Romagnolo can vary, and generally have floppy ears, and large round eyes in any shade color ranging from golden to a dark brown. Their water friendly coat is very thick and curly. Solid colors include off-white, golden, or brown. They can also be found white with brown or orange patches or roan. It is a medium to large sized dog that is hypoallergenic, which also means it almost never sheds. A Lagotto often displays white markings that grow out in adult status.','The Lagotto is made to work. They generally have sharp senses, though their eyesight is more sensitive to motion than detail. They are very loyal and loving, making them the perfect family companion. Some are easy to train, and many get along with other animals quite easily if they''re socialized as puppies.  Some Lagotti are excellent swimmers, but some will only paddle. Some will retrieve from lakes, streams and other bodies of water without hesitation. They are lovable family pets and tend to like attention. Lagotti love to dig; many owners give them a sandbox, or have a designated place to allow them satisfy their digging urges. They also love to play seeking games and have very active, and clever minds.'),
	('Leonberger','The Leonberger is a calm, large, muscular working dog with proud head carriage, level top line, and balanced build. They are a dimorphic breed, with males and females easily discernible as such. Males have strong, masculine heads while the female head expresses femininity. Tight flews, a distinguishing feature of the breed, provide for a dry mouth with no drooling. A soft, sweet expression, dark brown eyes, and a black mask are hallmarks of the Leonberger breed. For his size, the Leo is light on his feet and graceful in motion with a powerful, ground covering gait. Although a multi-purpose working breed, the Leonberger is primarily value as a loving companion, enthusiastically participating in most family endeavors and socializing at human gatherings.','First and foremost a family dog, the Leonberger''s temperament is one of its most important and distinguishing characteristics. Well socialized and trained, the Leonberger is self-assured, insensitive to noise, submissive to family members, friendly toward children, well composed with passersby, and self-disciplined when obliging its family or property with protection. Robust, loyal, intelligent, playful, and kindly, they can thus be taken anywhere without difficulty and adjust easily to a variety of circumstances, including the introduction of other dogs.'),
	('Lakeland Terrier','The Lakeland Terrier is a rather small dog of short-backed, square proportion with a sturdy, workmanlike build. Its legs are fairly long, enabling it to run at good speed and traverse the rugged shale terrain of its native mountain countryside. Its gait is smooth and ground-covering, with good reach and drive. Its body is deep and narrow, allowing it to squeeze through small passages after its quarry. Its expression reflects its mood, ranging from intense to gay or impish. Its double coat consists of a soft undercoat and a hard, wiry outer coat.','The spunky Lakeland makes the most of every day, always busy investigating, playing and, if it really gets its wish, hunting, running and chasing. Given daily exercise in a safe area, it settles down in the home and makes an entertaining and endearing house pet. It is reserved with strangers and usually aggressive toward other dogs and small animals. Clever, independent and stubborn, it can be mischievous. It is nonetheless sensitive and must be trained with patience as well as a sense of humor.'),
	('Lowchen','The Lowchen is a compact small dog, very slightly longer than it is tall, with strong, sturdy — but never coarse — bone. Its gait is effortless with good reach and drive, and it proudly carries its head and tail. Its coat is dense and long, moderately soft with a slight to moderate wave. It is traditionally clipped in a lion trim. The lowchen has a relatively short, broad top skull and muzzle, and its expression is alert, bright and lively.','This is a lively, inquisitive, affectionate dog. It is a mixture of playful spirit and calm soul mate, a good companion for a quiet family. It is willing to please and responsive to commands, and it is devoted to its family. Some may bark or dig a lot.'),
	('Large Munsterlander','The Large Munsterlander is a versatile pointing gun dog that is especially well known for its ability to locate and retrieve shot game, the Large Munsterlander is a black and white dog with elegant, clean lines and a distinct look of nobility. He gives the immediate impression of possessing a combination of strength and refinement.','First and foremost a working gun dog, this breed must be tractable, trainable and intelligent. It has a lively temperament, but is never nervous or hyperactive.'),
	('Lancashire Heeler','The Lancashire Heeler is a small but sturdy, powerful and energetic working dog, either black and tan or liver and tan, with a weather resistant double coat and a natural tail that is carried in a slight curve.','It is alert, friendly, energetic, intelligent, playful and a pleasant companion. Personality can range from lazy and playful to energenic and talkative. It is actually a very strong dog that likes to participate in all kinds of activities, and can carry a ball or object the size of themselves.The Lancashire Heeler is friendly towards its owners and passers-by on the street but may be aggressive towards an unknown character on their territory.'),
	('Landseer','The Landseer should convey the impression of a tall, powerful and well-balanced dog. The legs are comparatively longer than those of the black Newfoundland, especially in the male. The Landseer is elegant, harmonious, agile and hardy. The wide muzzle is rather short and squared-off. The small, triangular ears are pendant. The small eyes are dark brown; the conjunctiva should not show as it does in the St. Bernard. The nose is black. The feet are webbed for better swimming. Dewclaws should be removed on the hind legs. The tail hangs down.','The Landseer Newfoundland dog is known for its sweet disposition, gentleness, and serenity. They enjoy swimming and tend to drool, though not as much as some other giant breeds. While the Landseer European Continental Type is also sweet, affectionate and enjoys swimming, it is quite different from the Landseer Newfoundland in regard to response, agility and speed.'),
	('Lucas Terrier','The Lucas Terrier is a sturdy, symmetrically built, working terrier like an old-fashioned Ilmer Sealyham type, created only by crossing an existing Lucas Terrier with a Norfolk Terrier or with a small Sealyham Terrier. A latter-day Norfolk Terrier mated with a latter-day Sealyham Terrier does not produce a Lucas Terrier because it will not trace back to the original Lucas Terrier lines. All true Lucas Terriers have a direct connection to Sir Jocelyn Lucas''s original Ilmer Kennel based Lucas Terriers. The Lucas Terrier is bred primarily for temperament and companionship, and so should be friendly, with no aggressive tendencies towards people or other dogs, and not fearful or nervous while retaining the usual terrier traits. The coat should be fairly harsh, weather resistant and of medium length. It may be coloured or white, but the majority are tan, black and tan or saddle and tan. Dogs should weigh 14–20 lbs (6–9 kg) and bitches 11–17 lbs (5–8 kg).','The Lucas Terrier is a small, sweet, non-exaggerated British terrier that is making a comeback in popularity in the U.S. Smart and easy to train. Friendly toward people and other dogs. Excellent with children. Eagar to please. Not a yapper by nature. Likes to dig. Make sure you are this dog''s firm, confident, consistent pack leader to avoid Small Dog Syndrome, human induced behavior problems. Always remember, dogs are canines, not humans. Be sure to meet their natural instincts as animals.'),
	('Lurcher','The Lurcher has a short coat and a smooth undercoat that thickens in the winter. The legs are long and straight. The chest is deep, providing lung capacity for endurance. The small, wire-haired ears are high set. The small, dark eyes are round and alert. Colors vary widely since the Lurcher is derived from sighthound crosses. There is also a longhaired variety.','Temperament is also variable, again dependent on parental influence. As could be expected, lurchers with dominant sighthound attributes have similar temperaments—often fairly lazy with a good eye—however, accordingly, others are influenced by their other, often more tractable, biddable, and slower parent. As with all dogs, temperament will be modified by socialising the puppy.'),
	('Lapponian Herder','The Lapinporokoira is a medium-sized dog, with medium length fur in a double coat. Ears are pricked (standing up; drop ears are a disqualifying fault.) Colour is generally black or dark grey or brown, with a lighter shade on the head and lower parts of the body, often with white markings. Height should be 51 cm (20 in) at the withers for males, 46 cm (18 in) for females. Males and females should look distinctly different. Weight is between 55-65 pounds, males usually heavier than females.','The breed standard states that the dog should be calm, friendly, and docile, but also energetic. Most herding breeds need to be given regular exercise. The temperament of individual dogs may vary.'),
	('Miniature Schnauzer','The Miniature Schnauzer is a robust, sturdily built terrier of nearly square proportion. It was developed as a ratter and is quick and tough. Its gait displays good reach and drive. Its coat is double, with a close undercoat, and hard, wiry, outer coat which is longer on the legs, muzzle and eyebrows. Its facial furnishings add to its keen expression.','The miniature schnauzer deserves its place as one of the most popular terrier pets. It is playful, inquisitive, alert, spunky and companionable. It is a well-mannered house dog that also enjoys being in the middle of activities. It is less domineering than the larger schnauzers and less dog-aggressive than most terriers. It is also better with other animals than most terriers, although it will gladly give chase. It is clever and can be stubborn, but it is generally biddable. It enjoys children. Some may bark a lot.'),
	('Miniature American Shepherd','The Miniature American Shepherd is a small size herding dog that originated in the United States. He is slightly longer than tall with bone that is moderate and in proportion to body size and height without extremes. Movement is smooth, easy, and balanced. Exceptional agility combined with strength and stamina allows for working over a variety of terrain. This highly versatile, energetic dog makes an excellent athlete with superior intelligence and a willingness to please those to whom he is devoted. He is both a loyal companion and a biddable worker, which is evident in his watchful expression. He traditionally has a docked or natural bobtail.','Intelligent, willing to please, and devoted, the Miniature American Shepherd is a herding dog that can be an excellent family pet. Owners must devote time to socialization and training to direct the breeds strong working instincts and drive.

	('Mastiff','The massive Mastiff is heavy-boned with a powerful musculature, being slightly longer than tall. It combines great strength with endurance. Its power and strength are evident in its gait, which should have good reach and drive. Its double coat consists of a dense undercoat and a straight, coarse, outer coat of moderately short length. Its expression is alert but kindly. The overall impression should be one of grandeur and dignity.','The mastiff is innately good-natured, calm, easygoing and surprisingly gentle. It is a well-mannered house pet, but it needs sufficient room to stretch out. This is an extremely loyal breed, and though not excessively demonstrative, it is devoted to its family and good with children.'),
	('Maltese','Even though the breed is known for its coat, its body structure, facial expression and overall carriage are essential components of the type. The Maltese is a diminutive dog with a compact, square body, covered all over with long, flat, silky, white hair hanging almost to the ground. The expression is gentle yet alert. It is a vigorous dog, with a jaunty, smooth, flowing gait. The well-built Maltese seems to float over the ground when trotting.','They are one of the most gentle mannered of all little dogs, but are also full of energy and very playful, making them great family dogs. Maltese are highly intelligent and know very well how to use their charm to get their way. If given the chance, they become easily spoiled. This isn’t a problem for dog savvy owners, but many pet owners will give in, often resulting in a pet with poor manners. It is not recommended that Maltese go to homes with young children, where as tiny puppies, there is the possibility of being stepped on or dropped by a child.'),
	('Miniature Pinscher','The square-proportioned Miniature Pinscher has a compact, sturdy body with moderate tuck up and sort coupling. Its hallmark traits are its spirited animation, complete self-possession and high-stepping hackney gait. It is upstanding and alert. The coat is smooth, hard and short. It is among the most athletic of toy breeds.','Among the most energetic of all breeds, the min pin is a perpetual motion machine. It is busy, inquisitive, playful, bold and brash. It retains terrier-like traits and tends to be stubborn and independent. It can be scrappy with other dogs and may chase small animals. It is reserved with strangers.'),
	('Miniature Bull Terrier','The Miniature Bull Terrier is a strongly built, square-proportioned dog, big-boned but not coarse. It should reflect those attributes that made the standard-sized bull terrier a formidable foe in the fighting ring with its sturdy bone and muscle and strong jaws. Its gait is free and easy. Its skin is tight and its coat is short, flat and harsh. It wears a keen and determined expression on its characteristic clown face.','Very much like the larger bull terrier, the mini is comical, lively, playful and mischievous. Despite its smaller size, it is not a lap dog. It is every bit as tough as the larger version and apt to want to prove itself even more. It is a sweet clown, devoted but not fawning. It is stubborn and independent and needs to be trained with a firm yet gentle hand — and a good sense of humor. It likes to play and investigate. It likes to dig, and it needs ample exercise.'),
	('Manchester Terrier','The Manchester Terrier is perhaps the sleekest and raciest of all terriers, with a smooth, compact, muscular body, slightly longer than tall and a slightly arched topline. The combination of power and agility enables the breed to course and kill small game and vermin. Its gait is free and effortless, not hackney. Its expression is keen and alert, and its coat is smooth and glossy.','The Manchester terrier has been described as "catlike," being impeccably clean, independent, reserved with strangers, yet sensitive. It is more responsive than many terriers and is generally a well-mannered house dog. It is devoted to its family, and enjoys napping at its special person''s side. Otherwise, it is busy, ever nosing around for adventure or a game. Some tend to dig.'),
	('Miniature Bulldog','The Miniature Bulldog is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Bulldog and the Pug or the Olde Bulldog and the Pug. The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in any of the breeds in the hybrid. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses.','The Miniature Bulldog should not be confused with the Miniature English Bulldog, which is the purebred English Bulldog being bred down in size and called Miniature by some breeders.'),
	('Miniature Poodle','Miniature Poodles have a shoulder height of 28-38 cm (11-15 in) and weigh 7-8 kg (15-17 lbs). Poodles are very elegant in appearance. They have a long, narrow muzzle, slight stop (point at which the forehead meets the muzzle), dark eyes, and wide ears. Miniature Poodles have flat backs, straight, docked tails and small, oval feet. Their length is approximately the same as their height.','The Miniature Poodle is sensitive, intelligent, lively, playful, proud, and elegant. It bonds closely with family and makes a great companion. Miniature Poodles are very smart, obedient, and graceful, which makes them one of the most popular pets in the world.

	('Miniature Shar Pei','Miniature Shar Peis have a shoulder height up to 43 cm (17 in) and weigh up to 17 kg (38 lbs). Like their larger brethren, they are known for their blue-black tongue and profusely wrinkled head, neck, and shoulders.

Puppies have wrinkles all over their bodies.','The Miniature Shar Pei is affectionate, adaptable, playful, confident, calm, independent, regal, and alert. They are inherently clean and quiet. Some can be a bit aloof and though they are wise, obedience training requires a confident, consistent authority figure to prevent them from becoming overly dominant. This breed makes a delightful companion but is very independent with a temperament that will depend highly on how the owner treats the dog. It is a dog that bonds well with its family and is very devoted. Daily walks are needed to give the dog some exercise. During times of increased temperature walks should be shortened as these dogs are somewhat sensitive to the heat.'),
	('McNab','The McNab Dog is bred for its working ability and is not recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC). For this reason, the appearance of the McNab can vary considerably. The dog is medium sized with females standing 16-21 inches at the shoulder and weighing 30-50 pounds and males standing 18-25 inches at the shoulder and weighing 35-65 pounds. The dogs have a variety of ear sets from pricked ears to floppy ears and everything in between. Most McNabs are black or brown with white feet, white collars, white facial strips and white tipped tails, but tricolor McNabs are well known as well as mostly black McNabs. Some McNabs sport random white patches on their bodies and faces. Their eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and brown, hazel, or copper colored with occasional marble flecked or powder blue eyes. The McNab coat is close, dense and weather resistant. They can have a slick single short coat, a short double coat, or a medium length single coat, but their fur is never long. One of the distinctive features of the McNab is their catlike feet which contribute to their agility.','The McNabs reputation as an indefatigable "all-weather" dog is also opening up a new avenue of work for the dog: Search and Rescue. Currently McNabs are working as evidence search dogs, cadaver dogs, archaeology dogs, and area search dogs for missing persons. Where many other breeds have to be pulled off the search because the dog is tiring, the only limitation for the McNab is the energy of its handler.'),
	('Mudi','The Mudi is a medium-sized herding dog with spitz-like qualities. It has a wedge-shaped head, prick ears, moderate bone and a compact body with a sloping topline. The face and front of the legs are covered with short, smooth hair, while the rest of the coat is somewhat longer and very wavy to curly.

They learn quick both good things and bad. The Mudi may be aloof with strangers and early socialization is recommended.'),
	('Mountain Feist','The Mountain Feist stand about 35 to 45 cm (14 to 18 inches) high. They have a variety of colors but are mainly a light brown, black, and white. They have long pointy ears that stand upwards and button ears that fold over.

	('Mal-Shi','The Mal-Shi is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Maltese and the Shih Tzu. The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses.','The Mal-Shi is an intelligent, loyal, playful breed that requires moderate exercise and mental stimulation. Though quite independent, they are very eager to please and easily trained. They do well with older children, nearly all animals, and with those of whom they are accustomed.

Their coat is thick in a moderate length with the color white and red. Their puffy tail has that length that it could touch the floor. They are an average shedder and with a well arched chest, they generally give an impression of firmness and confidence.','Moscow Watchdog is fine in temperament, but it requires training and an owner committed to achieving leader status. In nature, dogs have pack order. Therefore, when humans live with dogs, it is a good idea for humans to establish themselves as a leader, a higher order than the dogs, so they can make directions and set rules. In this relationship Moscow Watchdog is known to be a gentle giant, assertive and protective to his family when in danger.'),
	('Mountain Cur','The Mountain Cur is a powerful, agile tree dog of medium size. The body is square or just slightly longer than tall. Legs are long enough to allow the dog to move quickly and with agility in rough terrain. The head is broad, with a moderate stop, and a muzzle slightly shorter than the length of skull. Ears are set high and drop. The tail is straight, set low, and may be a natural bob. The coat is dense but close fitting. The Mountain Cur should be evaluated as a working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work. Scars should neither be penalized nor regarded as proof of a dog’s working abilities.','The Mountain Cur is intelligent, easily trained, and neither vicious nor shy. They are known to always try to please their masters. They are not, however, dogs to be trifled with; historically many a cur died fighting to protect their family from attackers or dangerous predators. These curs were bred to work, and if deprived of the opportunity to hunt, guard, or work around a farm they will grow anxious and bored. When they have a job to do, these dogs are generally happy and obedient, and are able to get along well with children and other pets.'),
	('Majestic Tree Hound','The Majestic Tree Hound is a large to giant breed with males averaging over 100 pounds. They have the long, low-set earage (with a minimum length specified), heavy flew and dewlap of their ancestors from the Ardennes. They carry more excess skin in general than the American Blue Gascon, and are noteworthy for their abundant flew and dewlap, as well as facial wrinkles.','The Majestic Tree Hound is a good-natured and affectionate hound, accepting equally both praise and correction. It is not quarrelsome with other dogs and has a noble and dignified expression.'),
	('Newfoundland','The Newfoundland is a large, heavy-boned, powerful dog that is strong enough to pull a drowning man from rough seas and imposing enough to make an effective guard dog.

Its double coat consists of a soft, dense undercoat and a coarse, moderately long and straight outer coat. Its soft expression reflects its benevolent and dignified temperament.','The Newfoundland dog is known for its calm and docile nature and its strength. They are highly loyal and make ideal working dogs. It is for this reason that this breed is known as "the gentle giant". International kennel clubs generally describe the breed as having a sweet temper. It typically has a deep bark, and is easy to train if started young. They are wonderfully good with children, but small children can get accidentally leaned on and knocked down. Newfoundlands are ideal companions in the world of therapy and are often referred to as the nanny dog. The breed was memorialized in "Nana", the beloved guardian dog in J.M. Barrie''s Peter Pan. The Newfoundland in general is good with other animals, but its size can cause problems if it is not trained.'),
	('Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever','Because Tollers run as much as they swim when hunting, they are smaller and more agile than most other retrievers. Their powerful yet compact build enables them to rush around tirelessly, leaping and retrieving with tail always wagging. The jaws are strong enough to carry a duck. Because they were bred to work in icy waters, they have a water-repelling double coat of medium length. A longer coat is not appropriate for a working dog, although the tail feathering should be long, adding to the emphasis of the wagging tail. A white blazeon the face, chest, tail tip or feet is characteristic, and may serve to make the dog''s gamboling more noticeable to distant ducks.','As befitting a dog bred to play and retrieve tirelessly, the Toller is very energetic and playful. You cannot throw a ball just once for a Toller! Everything they do is done with gusto, whether it''s hunting, obedience, agility or just walking around the block. They are alert but not hyperactive, and can adjust to many circumstances. They are affectionate and gentle, but young Tollers can be overly boisterous at times. They are good with children, other dogs and pets. Tollers may be initially wary of strangers, but warm up quickly. They learn fast and are generally willing to please, but bore easily and then can be a bit stubborn.');

INSERT INTO breeds_webscraped VALUES ('Norwegian Elkhound','A typical Northern spitz-like breed, the Norwegian elkhound is square-proportioned, close coupled, with substantial bone, broad head, pricked ears and tightly curled tail. It is constructed for agility and endurance, rather than speed, enabling it to trail for hours and then hold big game at bay by barking and dodging attack. Its trot is effortless. It has a thick, smooth-lying coat consisting of straight outer hairs and a wooly undercoat. This combination presents the best protection against cold and snow.','The Norwegian Elkhound combines traits of hounds and spitz-like dogs, resulting in a breed that is bold, playful, independent, alert, boisterous and — unlike most hounds — even protective. This is a dog ready for adventure and happiest if that adventure takes place outdoors in cold weather. It needs daily exercise, lest it become frustrated or even destructive. It is friendly with strangers but may quarrel with strange dogs. It tends to pull when on leash unless trained, and it may bark a lot.'),
	('Neapolitan Mastiff','With its massive size made even more imposing by its abundant loose skin and dewlap, the Neapolitan Mastiff may have the most alarming appearance of any dog, and some say this look was purposefully bred in order to scare away intruders without the dog having to act. However, when forced to act, the Neo can spring into action with surprising speed. Its massive muscular body can knock down almost any intruder. Its huge head with short, powerful jaws and large teeth can crush or hold an opponent. The skin is tough and hanging, adding to the imposing impression of size as well as formidable expression.','The Neapolitan Mastiff was bred for centuries to guard its family. As such, it is incredibly loyal and devoted to its family, watchful and suspicious of strangers, and tolerant of acquaintances. It is a stay-at-home-type dog. Although it is loving toward children, its sheer size can make accidents possible. It may not get along well with other dogs, especially domineering-type dogs. Because of its size, it should be carefully socialized at an early age.'),
	('Norwich Terrier','This spirited dog, one of the smallest of the working terriers, is sturdy and stocky, of square proportion. Its small size is an asset when following vermin or fox down tight passageways. Its teeth are large, to aid in dispatching its quarry. It shows great power in its movement. The tail should be long enough to grasp firmly, so that the dog can be pulled from a hole. The double coat has a hard, wiry and straight outer coat that lies close to the body and is thicker around the mane for protection. The dog bears a slightly foxy expression.','The Norwich Terrier, like the Norfolk, is a true terrier at heart, always ready for adventure and excitement. It is a hunter and may chase small animals. It is a pert, independent, amusing — but sometimes challenging — companion, best suited for people with a sense of adventure and humor.'),
	('Norfolk Terrier','Unlike the Norwich terrier, the Norfolk is slightly longer than it is tall. Like the Norwich, it is a formidable adversary to vermin and fox and can bolt and dispatch its quarry working along or with a pack. It is small, short-legged and compact, with good bone and substance. Its gait is low and driving. Its double coat is weather resistant, with the outer coat consisting of hard, wiry, straight hair about 1½ to 2 inches long, with a longer ruff. It wears a keen, intelligent expression.','Feisty, bold, inquisitive, game, scrappy, stubborn and independent, the Norfolk is all terrier. It has been called a "demon" in the field, and it loves to hunt, dig and investigate. It must be exercised in a safe area. It is clever and amiable but strong-willed.'),
	('Norwegian Buhund','The Norwegian Buhund belongs to a large class of dogs called the Spitz type. Bred as an energetic working dog, Buhunds herd livestock and guard home and family. Today, they are also trained to aid the hearing impaired, perform some types of police work, and perform in obedience and agility trials. Their thick coat is wheaten (pale cream to bright orange) or black in color.','While Norwegian Buhunds make excellent watch dogs, they are also content to lie at your feet at the end of a hard day. Training wise, the Buhund is considered by many to be the most trainable of the Spitz breeds, but obedience training is still a necessity. Because the Buhund was born to herd and sound the alarm, the Buhund needs training and a job to do. Because they are happiest near their owner, they have earned the nickname, “the friendly spitz.”'),
	('Norwegian Lundehund','The Norwegian Lundehund is a small and agile Spitz breed with several unique characteristics in combination not found in any other dog. Features such as six toes on each foot; prick ears that fold closed, forward or backward at will; and the ability to tip the head backward until it touches the back bone all helped them perform their job as Puffin hunter. Their dense coat ranges from fallow to reddish brown to tan in color, with black hair tips and white markings, or white with red or dark markings.','Their superior personality, even disposition and small size make them an ideal, easy-to-live-with pet, although they may be wary of strangers. Consistency in the home environment is extremely important, as is consistency in training, house training, and socialization. Lundehund is very sensitive and can develop trust issues with an owner who tries to trick him into doing things - you can only fool a Lundehund once. They are incredibly clever and fun-loving, making them delightful and sometimes challenging.'),
	('Norrbottenspets','The Norrbottenspets should be a light spitz dog, yet powerful in appearance. There should be lightness and power reflected in the dog. Males are noticeably more masculine than females, who are smaller and of lighter build. It should give the impression of being alert, spritely, and intelligent. In proportions the Norrbottenspets is slightly taller than long - fit for the original use as a hunter. The tail should curl over the back and rest on the hips.','The Norrbottenspets is a physical mixture of endurance, speed, and strength. The ribcage has elements of both speed and strength. Viewed from the front the ribcage is oval and relatively deep, half from height. The ribcage is also relatively long with well-developed last ribs. The arched neck, distinguishable withers and slightly slanting croup makes the lines of the body very speedy. The underline has only a slight tuck up, which with the long ribcage reflects endurance.'),
	('Northern Inuit Dog','The Northern Inuit Dog is of medium to large build, athletic but never racy. Females should be between 23 and 28 inches (58–71 cm) tall and weigh around 55–84 pounds (25–38 kg), while males should be between 25 and 30 inches (58–81 cm) tall and weigh 79–110 pounds (36–48 kg). The dog should have a double coat and a straight tail – curly tails are considered a fault.','The Northern Inuit Dog is not for the novice owner as they can be very stubborn and are very quick-witted. The owner of a Northern Inuit must show themselves to be a strong leader or be prepared to be the underdog, and be taken advantage of. They are more difficult to train than other, more biddable breeds. Separation anxiety may arise when they are left alone and unsupervised too long, leading to destructive behaviours but training to be left from a young age will rectify this. Training from the onset is a must for this breed. Often, they will do better with another dog for company. Socialization should begin when vaccinated and throughout as their play can be very rough and misinterpreted.'),
	('New Guinea Singing Dog','The New Guinea Singing Dog is not like your average domesticated dog and is not recommended as a house pet for most people as it is closely related to a wild dog. If properly socialized, it can be tame enough to tolerate the handling of humans, getting attached to its owners.','The New Guinea Singing Dog, also known as Hallstrom’s dog, is named for its distinctive and melodious howl, which is characterized by a sharp increase in pitch at the start and very high frequencies at the end. NGSDs are active, lively, and alert. They are constantly exploring everything in their environment, using all five senses, including taste. Their incredible structural flexibility allows them to pass their bodies through any opening wide enough to admit their head. Their hunting drive is very intense and may overwhelm any training when prey is detected. They use their acute sense of hearing in addition to sight and scent to locate prey. Although gentle and affectionate with people they know, they can be aloof with strangers. NGSDs can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially of the same sex. Its howl has an eerie yet synchronized quality, which gives the breed its name. The howl can be spurred when the dog is disturbed or excited. One tone blends with the next, sending goose bumps up a listener''s back. Opera singers have expressed a particular interest in this vocally skillful canine. This is a hardy and well-balanced dog. The Singing Dog is similar to the Dingo, although smaller than its near relative.'),
	('Old English Sheepdog','The Old English Sheepdog is a square-proportioned, thick-set dog, combining agility with strength. Its compact body is broader at the rump than shoulders. A distinguishing characteristic is the top-line, which is lower at the withers than the loin. Its gait is free, powerful and ground-covering, yet gives the appearance of being effortless. This breed may pace or amble at slower speeds. Its ambling gait is sometimes described as a "bearlike" roll or shuffle. The coat is profuse, but not excessive. It consists of a waterproof undercoat and a hard, shaggy outer coat that is neither straight nor curly. The expression is intelligent. The bobtail''s bark should be loud, with a "pot-casse" ring to it.','The breed standards describe the ideal Old English Sheepdog as never being nervous or aggressive. The New Zealand Kennel Club adds that "they are sometimes couch potatoes" and "may even try to herd children by gently bumping them." This breed''s temperament can be described as intelligent, social and adaptable. The American Kennel Club adds that the breed has "a clownish energy" and "may try to herd people or other objects." With wide open spaces being the ideal setting for an Old English Sheepdog, the breed is a natural fit in a rural setting, such as working on a farm; although, with proper exercise and training, they are perfectly comfortable with a suburban or urban lifestyle. Their remarkable, inherent herding instincts, sense of duty, and sense of property boundaries may be nurtured and encouraged accordingly, or subdued by their owners. Old English Sheepdogs should not be deprived of the company and the warmth of people.'),
	('Otterhound','The Otterhound is a large dog with a somewhat stocky build, slightly longer than tall, not exaggerated in any way, enabling it to trot at a slow, steady pace for long distances without tiring. Its coat, which consists of a rough, coarse outer coat combined with a soft wooly slightly oily undercoat, is essential for protecting it from brambles and cold water. It has a fairly large nose and muzzle, allowing ample room for olfactory receptors. Its large feet provide traction over rough and slippery terrain. This is a strong athletic breed that can withstand harsh weather and long strenuous hunts. Its expression is open and amiable, reflecting its temperament. The otterhound is noted for its steadfast pursuit of its quarry despite the roughest of conditions. It has an acute sense of smell and can trail unerringly through running water and over all sorts of terrain.','As a pack hound, the otterhound is amiable with other dogs. As a hunter, it has an innate urge to follow the trails of mammals. Once on the trail, it is determined, single-minded and nearly impossible to dissuade from its task. Even though the otterhound''s job was not to kill its quarry, it will nonetheless give chase to small animals. The otterhound loves to hunt, sniff, trail and, especially, swim. At home it is boisterous, amiable and easygoing (although stubborn), affectionate with its family, and quite good with children. Because the otterhound was never traditionally kept as a pet, it is not among the most responsive of breeds. However, the otterhound is a low-key dog that can function as a quiet companion.'),

This breed likes to chew and should be supplied with plenty of toys and bones. This breed tends to drool and slobber.'),
	('Poodle','The Standard Poodle is a medium-sized, squarely built dog with a distinctive harsh curly coat that may be presented in any of several traditional Poodle clips or corded. The ears are long, drop, and densely feathered. The tail is normally docked, set high, and carried erect. The length of body (sternum to point of buttocks) is equal to the height (withers to ground). The Standard Poodle carries himself with an air of dignity and pride. The Standard Poodle should be evaluated as a working gun dog and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','The Standard Poodle’s most readily identifiable characteristic is its harsh, dense coat, which is presented in various traditional trims or, less frequently, corded. Another essential characteristic is proper temperament. The breed is noted for its high intelligence, trainability and sense of humor. Poodles are highly social and require human companionship and regular, close interaction with family members. Because of their great intelligence and the joy they take in human companionship, Poodles excel in performance events of all sorts. They are extremely affectionate with children.'),
	('Pembroke Welsh Corgi','The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is moderately long and low, and less heavily boned than the Cardigan Welsh corgi. Its movement is free and smooth, with good reach and drive.

It combines a weather-resistant undercoat of medium length with a coarser outer coat of slightly longer length. Its expression is intelligent and interested, foxy, but not sly.','Quick and quick-witted, the Pembroke Welsh corgi has an active mind and body.

Its coat is fine, smooth and short.','The Pug breed is often described by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or "much in little" or "a lot of dog in a small space", alluding to the Pug''s remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size. Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them.

Its hallmark characteristic, besides its friendly temperament and alert expression, is its butterfly ears.','The temperament of a papillon is a happy, friendly, adventurous dog. They are not shy or aggressive.

	('Picardy Spaniel','Typical examples of the breed measure between 22–24 inches (56–61 cm) at the withers, with the average weight between 20–25 kilograms (44–55 lb).

In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However it can also be used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits.

This breed is highly intelligent and generally responds well to basic training and commands. As a pet, the Prague Ratter is obedient, loyal, loving, and very affectionate. The Prague Ratter adapts well to full-time indoor and apartment living, yet still enjoys spending time outdoors, playing games such as fetch, and taking long and leisurely walks. They are also known to be a very quiet dog unlike many other small dogs who tend to be very "yappy". Like any small dog one should be wary of allowing them to develop Small Dog Syndrome as they can become aggressive if they are not well-socialized from an early age.'),
	('Pont-Audemer Spaniel','The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is a medium-sized dog, weighing 44 to 60 pounds (20–27 kg), and standing around 50–58 centimetres (20–23 in) at the withers. It is different from most sporting dog breeds in the USA and UK in its length, and the pointed quality of the muzzle.The Pont-Audemer Spaniel''s coat is curly or, at the very least, quite wavy, but smooth around the face. The most common pattern is brown and white roan but a solid brown coat is also acceptable. Both coat patterns can have red-brown “dead leaf glints”. Black or tan markings are faults. The hair on the face is short. The topknot can take up to five years to fully develop. Most Pontos have docked tails. Tails that are left intact are usually well feathered like that of a setter, although it is not unheard of for a Ponto to have the shorthaired “rat-tail” of an Irish Water Spaniel.','Though hardy, as well as hard-working, the breed has the typical spaniel traits of being easy to train, gentle, and affectionate. The dogs are known to have a fun-loving quality and in France are said to be le petit clown des marais (the little clown of the marshes). Pont-Audemer Spaniels are usually found in a working gundog environment, and are rarely kept as mere family pets. The dogs specialize as water dogs. At the start of the 20th century they were prized for their use in hunting wild ducks in either the water or marshy conditions. They remain used in France in various terrain, and used for hunting rabbits or pheasants.'),

They have a heavy white coat with large darker spots. The average weight is about 81 kilograms (179 lb), although males can often weigh over 100 kilograms (220 lb).','The Pyrenean Mastiff can be hard to control at times due to his large size. He can be intimidating to some people who are not familiar with large breed dogs. As a livestock guardian dog, he will be protective of his home and his family. Training and socialization should be started at a young age to ensure he does not become shy or overly aggressive when meeting strangers. He is generally a mild mannered dog and easy to train, however, there must be a strong leader within the family to train him or he will try to take that position. He does well with children as long as they respect his space and he does excellent with other animals. He may need to be watched around other dogs, especially of the same gender.

They are territorial, loyal and protective of their owners, and are very good watchdogs for this reason. They have a very loud bark and will bark at anything that is suspicious, as they are trying to protect their family. Since they were trained to be cautious and not attack until completely necessary when predators were around sheep, The Polish Tatra Sheepdog will not bite a stranger or other animals unless continuously provoked, leading them to be considered very dog and animal friendly. From thousands of years of guarding sheep, they are very intelligent, calm and independent.'),
	('Puggle','The Puggle is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Beagle and the Pug. The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses. The first Puggles ever bred were bred by a breeder named Wallace Havens.','The Puggle gets along well with children, other dogs and household pets. It may show signs of jealousy, however, if it feel ignored by it''s owner.'),

The ears fold over like most terriers, and the nose and eye are typically black, and the jaw has a good scissors bite.','A generally game working dog, the Plummer Terrier is not a Kennel Club breed, and most Plummer Terrier owners who work their dogs would prefer that this dog was not part of the Kennel Club. The Plummer Terrier appears to be a breed that has caught on in popularity among a segment of the working terrier set, and with increased restrictions on fox hunting in the UK, its popularity as a ratting dog is likely to increase.'),
	('Portuguese Pointer','The Portuguese Pointer is a medium-sized, well-balanced dog with a distinctive “square” face, drop ears, and a tail that is carried pendant when the dog is standing and level with the back or slightly above when the dog is moving. The body of the Portuguese Pointer is almost square. The Portuguese Pointer should be evaluated as a working gun dog and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.','The Portuguese Pointer has strong hunting instincts. In the field, the Portuguese Pointer is a tenacious hunter in all sorts of terrain and climate. The dog’s affectionate nature is so intense that the Portuguese standard describes it as “…occasionally even embarrassing”. This devotion, however, makes the Portuguese a joy in the field because no dog delights more in sharing the hunt with its master.'),
	('Polish Hunting Dog','Strong, compact and quite massive, the Polish Hound gives the appearance of endurance rather than speed.','Stable and gentle, this dog is courageous and has demonstrated proof of bravery.

This is a powerful breed that needs socialization, consistent training and daily exercise to be the best it can be — a loyal family member and guardian.'),
	('Rhodesian Ridgeback','Slightly longer than tall, the Rhodesian Ridgeback combines speed, power and endurance. The Ridgeback must have an athletic build to enable it to catch up to a lion and then harass it without being hurt. Because the lion is not the only quarry of the Ridgeback, the dog must also be strong enough to bring down other large game. Its stride is efficient and long. The short glossy coat is adapted for working in hot climates. A distinctive feature is the clearly defined ridge, which should start with two identical whorls just behind the shoulders and taper to a point between the hipbones.','The Rhodesian Ridgeback is the hound group''s answer to a somewhat protective dog. Not only is it a keen and versatile hunter, but it is a loyal guardian. It is good with children, especially protective of those in its family, but it is sometimes overly boisterous in play for small children.

The coat is short and smooth, but coarse enough to provide protection.','Redbones are generally easygoing, gentle dogs that don''t let much bother them. They want to be with their people, but aren''t clingy or "in your face." Redbones are eager to please but can become bored with formal training. They are active when on the hunt, but quiet inside. Their passion is hunting, and once the nose hits a scent they are oblivious to much else. Redbones get along well with people, children, and dogs, but may or may not do well with small pets.'),

Bolonka dogs are considered suitable for people with allergies, as they are bred to be hypoallergenic. Breeds that don''t shed are more likely to be hypoallergenic, since the dog''s dander and saliva stick to the hair and are not released into the environment. The frequent trimming, brushing, and bathing required to keep the Bolonka looking its best removes hair and dander and controls saliva. It is important to note that how hypoallergenic a particular dog is for a particular person may vary with the individual dog and the individual person.','The Tsvetnaya Bolonka is even-tempered, intelligent, friendly to all, and should never be shy or show aggression of any kind. The Russian Tszvetnaya Bolonka was specifically developed as a companion dog and is prized for its sociable, easy-going and affectionate temperament. Its specimens will avoid exuberant games and won’t appreciate any extent of physical abuse during playing. The Bolonka Zwetna usually perceives all unfamiliar people as potential play mates and without timely socialization it can grow into an inappropriate greeter.

	('Smooth Fox Terrier','The Smooth Fox Terrier is square-proportioned, standing over a lot of ground but with a short back. Its conformation combines speed, endurance and power, enabling it to gallop and stay with the horses and hounds during the hunt and to follow a fox up a narrow passage. The gait while trotting gets most of its propulsion from the rear quarters. The expression, like the attitude, is keen; the carriage is alert and expectant. The coat is flat, hard and dense, also with a short, fine undercoat.','The Smooth Fox Terrier is friendly, alert, active, and lively without being high-strung. Through his keen expression and alert bearing, ears up and tail quivering, the Smooth Fox Terrier gives the impression of a dog ready to go anywhere and take on any task. The Smooth Fox Terrier is bold but not aggressive with people. They are affectionate with children but may be too active for some. Although seldom used for hunting now, the Smooth Fox Terrier retains a strong prey drive and will dig tirelessly after any underground vermin.'),
	('Saluki','The Saluki has a general greyhound-like build and should combine grace, symmetry, great speed and endurance. Likwise, it should have the strength to enable it to kill gazelle or other quarry over deep sand or rocky mountains. Its expression should be dignified and gentle, with deep, faithful, far-seeing eyes. Its movement is light. The coat is smooth and silky; the feathered variety has long hair on its ears, tail, between its toes and sometimes on the backs of its legs; the smooth variety has no long feathering. This breed has a wide range of equally acceptable types, reflecting the wide area over which it was developed.','The Saluki tends to be aloof and reserved with strangers. It is extremely devoted to its own family, but it is not particularly demonstrative. The Saluki is very gentle with children, but it may not be playful enough to satisfy most of them. Extremely sensitive, it does not take to rough-and-tumble play or deal well with harsh corrections. Some Salukis can be shy. This breed is very quiet and sedate indoors, seeking out a soft, warm spot. Outside, it runs in great circles at tremendous speeds and will chase any small running animals or fast-moving objects. It may not come when called.'),
	('Swedish Vallhund','The low-slung dog may resemble his Corgi cousins, but the Swedish Valhund is a distinct breed that has existed for some thousand years. In his homeland of Sweden, the Vallhund was a valued farm dog used to herd livestock by nipping at their heels. He has many good qualities, including his size and easy-care coat, but he’s not the right breed for everyone.','Friendly and even-tempered Vallhunds are among the world’s most vocal breeds. They’re so chatty that their language of yips, howls, and barks has its own name: “argle bargle.” These smart, energetic dogs do best with owners willing to engage them with work or sports. Vallhunds are zesty companions. “They have a sense of humor and a real joy for life,” says one longtime owner. Loyal and easily trained, both hardworking and fun loving, the Vallhund has it all, except numbers: It’s an exceedingly scarce breed.'),
	('Sealyham Terrier','The Sealyham Terrier is a short-legged terrier, slightly longer than it is tall. Its body is strong, short-coupled and substantial, allowing for plenty of flexibility. This combination of short legs with a strong and flexible body allows the Sealyham to maneuver in tight quarters. Its weather-resistant coat consists of a soft, dense undercoat and a hard, wiry outer coat. This is a keen, alert and determined breed and should look the part.','One of the calmer terriers, the Sealyham is nonetheless ready for action, always happy to investigate, dig or give chase. It is often aggressive toward other dogs or pets. It is a well-mannered house dog but needs some daily exercise. It is reserved with strangers, but devoted to its family. It is stubborn and independent. It digs and barks.'),
	('Spanish Water Dog','The Spanish Water Dog is a medium size, athletic, robust dog that is slightly longer than tall. Their tails are usually docked in the US, but undocked tails are not a fault in conformation showing if the dog was bred in a non-docking country. The head should be strong and carried with elegance. The skull is flat and the top is parallel with the top of the muzzle. The nose, eye-rims and paw pads are the same colour as the darkest part of the coat or darker. The eyes are expressive and set fairly wide apart. They should be hazel, chestnut or dark brown in colour, depending on the coat colour. The ears are set at medium height on the skull, and are triangular.','The Spanish Water Dog is diligent, loyal, affectionate, and intelligent. They have very strong natural herding and guarding instincts, leading them to become the "self-appointed" guardians of their homes. SWDs thrive on work and play. Their athleticism and extremely hard working nature leads them to excel at any number of tasks. They can be wary with strangers, and early and continuing socialization with a variety of people and other animals is essential for a well-adjusted, social dog. Good socialization at an early age greatly helps them cohabit with small children.'),
	('Scottish Deerhound','The Scottish Deerhound has a body like that of a greyhound but is of larger size and bone, enabling it to run at great speed using the double-suspension gallop without sacrificing strength and endurance. Its trotting gait is easy and true. Its hair is harsh and crisp, about 3 to 4 inches long on the body, ideally close-lying. Such a coat imparts a weather- (and dirt-) resistant quality, an essential asset in cold, damp climates.','The Scottish deerhound is mellow, low-key and easygoing — a gracious and well-mannered addition to the home. Outdoors, it loves to run and chase anything that moves. Indoors, it needs plenty of room to stretch on a soft surface. The deerhound is independent but willing to please; it is extremely sensitive. It is amiable toward, but often reserved with, strangers. This breed is good with children, other dogs and usually other pets, although it may give chase to strange animals.'),
	('Sussex Spaniel','The long, low, "rectangular" body, coupled with a muscular and rather massive physique, allows the Sussex to penetrate dense cover when hunting. Its movement is deliberate and rolling because of its short legs and comparatively wide body, a gait that emphasizes power over speed. The abundant body coat is flat or slightly wavy, giving protection from thorns. A distinctive feature is the long feather between the toes, which should be long enough to cover the toenails. The expression is somber and serious, even frowning, but the wagging tail belies its true nature. The Sussex tends to bark when hunting, which helps the hunter locate it in thick cover.','The Sussex spaniel tends to be less playful and demonstrative than other spaniels, with a lower energy level. This makes it better suited for city life, but it still appreciates the chance to take to the wilds and hunt up birds. It tends to bark when hunting, which has made it less popular with hunters than other breeds; some also bark or howl when not hunting. At home it is calm, steady and easygoing, although it may be aggressive to strange dogs. Its somber expression is misleading because it is quite cheerful.'),
	('Skye Terrier','The Skye Terrier is a stylish and elegant dog that is, first of all, a working terrier. It is solidly built, with substantial bone, and twice as long as it is tall. The Skye''s short legs enable it to go to ground in pursuit of fox and badger, and the long back imparts flexibility within a confined space. Its strong jaws further aid it in dispatching its prey. Its movement is free and effortless. The hard outer coat and close undercoat afford protection from the teeth of its quarry as well as harsh weather. The outer coat lies straight and flat, 5½ inches or more in length.','The Skye terrier''s soft look belies its tough nature. It is a fearless and a deadly rodent hunter. It is also a mild-mannered house pet, one of the few terriers calm enough to live in the city. It still needs daily exercise in a safe area or on leash, however. It is sensitive yet stubborn. The Skye is affectionate with its family but cautious with strangers. It gets along fairly well with other dogs in the same household but may not mingle well with strange dogs. It is extremely courageous and game and makes a good watchdog.'),
	('Sloughi','The Sloughi is a medium-large, short-haired, smooth-coated, athletic sighthound developed in North Africa (in the area including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya) to hunt game such as hare, fox, jackal, gazelle, and wild pigs. It is an ancient breed, treasured in North Africa for its hunting skills, speed, agility, and endurance over long distances. It is a robust, but elegant and racy, pursuit dog with no exaggeration of length of body or limbs, muscle development, angulation, nor curve of loin. The Sloughi is not a fragile dog, but is also a dog with class and grace. The attitude is noble and somewhat aloof, and the expression of the dark eyes is gentle and melancholy. The Sloughi''s head is long and elegant with drop ears. The body and legs show defined bony structure and strong, lean muscles. The skeletal structure is sturdy. The topline is essentially horizontal blending into a bony, gently sloping croup. The tail is long and carried low with an upward curve at the end.','The Sloughi is an intelligent and very driven hunter which chases on sight what it considers moving prey, but also relies on olfactory and acoustic cues in the chase. In Africa the Sloughi is a working dog, primarily used for hunting. The Sloughi is typically loyal, playful and affectionate with family and cautious and watchful with strangers. The Sloughi does not respond well to harsh training, but benefits from a firm, consistent, fair and praising hand. (Faults: Sharpness or excessive shyness.)'),
	('Small Munsterlander','Males should stand between 20.5–22 in (52–56 cm), and females should stand between 19.75–21.25 in (50.2–54.0 cm) at the withers. The weight ranges between 38–58 lb (17–26 kg) with the males being the larger of the two. Strong and harmonious build of medium size, showing balanced proportions with a lot of quality and elegance. In upright posture the dog displays flowing outlines with a horizontally carried, well flagged tail. The dog should appear to be strong and balanced with a distinguished head. Its front legs are well feathered, the hind legs with breeches. The coat should be medium length, glossy, dense, and straight or slightly wavy. The dog''s movement should be graceful and far reaching. The coloration of the dog is large patches of brown on a ticked or solid white background.','Small Münsterländers are extremely intelligent, trainable, and attentive but require gentle and patient training. Coupled with their intelligence, if they determine an owner to be inconsistent or indecisive, the owner might find that the dog will challenge the owner. For training, both voice and hand signals are used, and a Small Münsterländer will routinely look back to check in with the hunter for silent signals at intervals when on hold or pointing. They have a very strong prey drive and enjoy rewarding their owner with productive hunts. They thrive with hunting or comparable challenging exercise for an hour or more every day. They are strong swimmers, especially when compared to other short-haired hunting breeds.'),
	('Saarloos wolfdog','The Saarlooswolfhond has a broad, powerful neck. The moderately broad head is slightly arched between the ears. The erect ears are large like the German Shepherd''s. The muzzle has a definite taper to the solid, dark nose. It has long legs with feet that turn slightly outward. The tail is densely feathered and low set. The coat is harsh and not too long with a dense undercoat. Coat colors include agouti, wolf-gray and wolf-brown with limited white markings.','The Saarloosewolfdog is lively, energetic and independent. The breed is devoted and reliable with its master but suspicious of strangers. A natural, wolf-like reserve and desire to flee from unknown situations is typical of this breed.'),
	('Sarplaninac','The Šarplaninac is a large, strongly built dog. The body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the front legs account for approximately 55% of the height. The head is large but proportional to the body, with dark eyes. All Šarplaninac are solid in colour: fawn, iron grey, white or almost black; usually sable or gray with darker "overalls" on the head and back, the undercoat being paler. The colour need not be completely uniform, and most Šarplaninac have several different shades of the same colour fading into one another. There are no bicolours and no uniformly black-coated dogs among purebreds, but odd-coloured specimens do exist. The dogs must not have large white patches in their coat.','The temperament of the breed is described as independent, reliable, protective but not snappy, incorruptible and devoted to its master. The breed is aloof with outsiders, and calm until a threat to the flock presents itself. The breed has an extremely protective nature. In the absence of a flock of sheep, the Šarplaninac will often treat its humans as sheep - herding them away from danger or undesirable areas. They are serene and majestic, gentle with children and smaller dogs. They are also highly intelligent and bred to work without human supervision while guarding the flocks in the high pastures. Young pups can kill small animals until trained not to hunt. Like many of its cousin Mountain dogs, the Šarplaninac is a very serious and dedicated guard dog. Due to this, they are naturally suspicious of strangers and will need good socializing at a young age to lessen this innate personality trait. They are calm and gentle with their family but when faced with danger they become a formidable foe, not a suitable breed for all. Consistent and firm training is essential to ensure compliance.'),
	('Schapendoes','The Schapendoes is a medium sized, lightly built, long coated dog that is equipped with great endurance, mobility and speed. His movement is springy and he is a remarkable jumper. Dense, double and lightly waved. Approximately 3 inches long in the region of the hindquarter. Definitely curly or frizzy hair is unacceptable. The individual hairs are fine and dry, never silky. The coat sometimes stands off in tufts. There is a definite topknot, mustache and beard.','The breed standard describes the Schapendoes as friendly, high spirited, and affectionate. He is not a guard dog or aggressively protective, and if properly socialised while young, would most likely make a good family dog, as well as a good dog for active sports. Lively and intelligent dogs must receive regular training and outings. Temperament of individual dogs may vary. The Schapendoes is furthermore very independent and cooperate with its trainer rather than obey orders.'),
	('Shikoku dog','The Shikoku stands 17–21 inches (43–53 cm) high and comes in sesame (red, black), black and tan (nonstandard color), or cream (nonstandard color). These colors consist usually of a light brown, a light red-brown, or a light black-brown. In addition, there is a cream colored coat that tends to be very rare. In all of these colors there is usually a mixture of white found around the underside of the body, near the eyes, snout, and legs. The Shikoku tends to shed its coat at least one to two times a year. The dog has a fairly thick coat with pointed ears and a curved tail. The body conformation is typically of the spitz-type: the square body, the wedge-shaped head, the prick triangular ears, and feathered curled tail.','It is cautious and brave; a temperate dog with good judgment. The Shikoku is also very loyal and submissive to its owner; it loves to be touched and often likes to give kisses. Although, it may be slightly aloof with strangers. This breed needs socialization early to avoid becoming aggressive toward other dogs. Dogs that do become dog aggressive need a competent owner/trainer who knows how to communicate to the dog that this is unacceptable behavior. Shikokus can get along with children if they are raised properly and vice-versa. They have a high prey drive and therefore may not be for everyone; should not be trusted with non-canine pets such as guinea pigs and hamsters.'),
	('Shiloh Shepherd dog','The Shiloh Shepherd''s overall appearance is rather heavy. The back is broad, strong and solid. The head is broad and noble, slightly domed and in proportion to the body. The width and length of the skull are approximately equal with a gently defined stop, strong developed cheekbones, and a gradually tapering muzzle. The muzzle should be predominantly black, the length being equal to that of the forehead, with the lips firmly fitted and solid black. The muzzle should not be long, narrow or snipey in appearance. Both upper and lower thighs are well muscled. The tail is quite long and thickly covered with dense hair, hanging down like a plume. The coat comes in two varieties: smooth and plush. The plush coat is medium-length with a dense undercoat and has a distinct mane from the neck to the chest. Hair should not be more than 5" (12 cm) in length. The smooth coat is thick and medium-length with the outer hair being harsh to the touch.','Bred as companions, Shilohs have loyal and outgoing personalities. Many of the breeders in the United States operate out of large farms where the puppies are introduced to a large variety of animals. They were developed to be gentle and loving, able to work with animals and children, while still possessing a trainable drive for working applications, such as assistive service, obedience, or herding. Shiloh Shepherds are reported to be the least territorial when compared to other Shepherd breeds. With proper socialization they adapt easily to a variety of environments and are stable. Extreme aggression or shyness is severely penalized in the breed standard.'),
	('Silken Windhound','The Silken Windhound is an elegant, small to medium-sized sighthound, with a moderately long, silky coat. Its classic lines and athletic build are the hallmarks of a true coursing dog. When viewing a Silken Windhound, one has the impression of grace, balance and strength integrated with exceptional running ability. In proportion, they are approximately square or slightly rectangular. Silkens that are excessively longer or shorter than they are tall are to be penalized to the extent of the deviation. The build of the Silken Windhound is sleek, through a balanced combination of fine bladed bone and smooth muscle, and never looks frail.','Silken Windhounds are affectionate and playful and are good dogs for families with children. Owing to their friendliness, they are not good guard dogs but are easily house broken and can be trained to live with smaller household pets. Silkens particularly like agility, therapy, flyball, and obedience. Silken Windhounds are often intelligent and easily trained using reward and affection in short, positive sessions and will work eagerly and form strong relationships with their owners if so treated. Like many sighthounds, Silken Windhounds can slip out of buckle collars, so most owners favour semi-slip collars.'),
	('Spanish Mastiff','The Spanish Mastiff is a very large and powerful dog, similar in appearance to the other Mastiff breeds. They have a large powerful head and serious and vigilant expression. It has small eyes and drop ears resembling triangles. This dog''s coat is most often fawn-colored, but can also be brindle, black or ''wolf'' colored. Reddish tones indicate miscegenation.','This noble giant is aloof, dignified, calm and intelligent. It is devoted to its family and may politely accept strangers if it has been socialized properly, although it will be wary of them. It can be aggressive toward other dogs. The Spanish Mastiff may be a less-than-ideal pet in urban situations, where its booming voice and massive size could be problematic. It is a wonderful protector of its home and family. And an ideal protector of herds and flocks from wolf predation. Socialization and training should begin early to ensure this dog a stable and reliable pet. Supervised exposure in puppy-hood to a variety of unfamiliar but non-threatening dogs will help dampen a tendency to aggression toward other dogs. The breed is quite alert and food motivated but can bore easily; training must be consistent and firm but gentle. Once the trainer has established the dog''s respect as leader, the Spanish Mastiff will be an extremely loyal pet.'),
	('Swedish Lapphund','The Swedish Lapphund is a typical spitz type dog of slightly less than medium size, with proud head carriage, and a weather resistant coat.

''Dog Breed Info'' says the Zuchon is a dog "known for his endearing face, large expressive eyes, and his soft teddy-bear coat." The Zuchon usually has a longer coat that does not shed very much, if at all. This longer coat may lead to more time for maintenance and grooming. As hypoallergenic dogs, Zuchons are generally more suitable for homes with allergy problems amongst the inhabitants, although allergic reactions may still occur.','This toy dog is said to have a "great" personality, and it is playful, lively and well-mannered. They can be a bit stubborn, but when they are trained well, they are a good family pet. They are easily trained. The Zuchon is a well-mannered dog known to be social, happy, and gentle.

When necessary, this dog will bark to alert its family that someone is nearby. This breed is typically good with other pets, especially when socialized at an early age.

	('Stabyhoun','Most Stabyhouns have a black and white colored coat with often a solid fully colored, usually black, head and white tipped tail. Brown and white Stabyhouns are less common, but may be seen in the Netherlands, while the orange and white coated Stabyhouns are becoming increasingly rare. Spotting and/or roan in the white are acceptable, but tricolor is considered a fault. Males are 53 cm (21 in) and females are 49 cm (19 in), measured at the withers. The ideal weight of a Stabyhoun is 40 lb (18 kg) for a female and 50–55 lb (23–25 kg) for a male.','The Stabyhoun has a gentle disposition.

	('Spanish Greyhound','The Spanish Greyhound are similar in appearance to Greyhounds, but are distinctly different in their conformation. Galgos are higher in the rear than in the front, and have flatter muscling than a Greyhound, which is characteristic of endurance runners. They also tend to be smaller, lighter in build, have longer tails and have a very long, streamlined head that gives the impression of larger ears. Their chests are not as deep as a Greyhound''s and should not reach the point of the elbow. Unlike Greyhounds, Galgos come in two coat types: smooth and rough. The rough coat can provide extra protection from skin injuries while running in the field. They come in a variety of colors and coat patterns. Main colors are "barcino" or "atigrado" (brindle), "negro" (black), "barquillo"(golden), "tostado"(toasted), "canela" (cinnamon), "amarillo"(yellow), "rojo"(red), "blanco" (white), "berrendo" (white with patches) or "pío" (any colour with white muzzle and forehead).','Galgos have a very similar nature to Greyhounds. They are calm, quiet, gentle and laid back; happy to sleep their day away on their backs on a sofa. More than 90% of Galgos can be considered cat-friendly and are therefore an ideal choice for the hound lover who also owns cats. Almost all Galgos are also friendly towards other dogs and small dogs. Galgos are also very good with children, being calm in the house so there is less risk of a child being knocked over or jumped on than with a more excitable breed. They are very gentle and tolerate the often over-enthusiastic attentions of children with little risk of retaliation from the dog. Galgos have a very reserved personality and they have a tendency towards shyness, so it is very important that they be socialized early in life so that they grow up to be comfortable around strange people, dogs and locations.'),
