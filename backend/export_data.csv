Australian Shepherd,"This is an athletic dog of medium size and bone; it is lithe, agile and slightly longer than it is tall. It is muscular and powerful enough to work all day, without sacrificing the speed and agility necessary to cope with bolting livestock. Its gait is free and easy, and it must be able to change direction or speed instantly. Its double coat is weather resistant, with the outer coat of medium texture and length, straight to wavy. The expression is keen, intelligent and eager.","The Australian shepherd has a great deal of stamina and is loving, bold, alert, confident, independent, smart and responsive. If it doesn't get a chance to exercise and challenge its strongly developed mental and physical activities, it is apt to become frustrated and difficult to live with.

American Cocker Spaniel,"The smallest member of the sporting group, the American Cocker Spaniel should be compact and sturdy. Its gait is ground-covering, strong and effortless. The coat is silky, flat or slightly wavy, not overly long. Excessive coat can hinder the dog in the field. The head and expression are hallmarks of the breed; the expression is soft and appealing. Though seldom used for its original purpose, the cocker should still be able to spend a day in the field and should be balanced and athletic. It is true, however, that most cockers now have too much coat for field work.","This breed is known as the ""merry"" cocker, and the name is most fitting. It is playful, cheerful, amiable, sweet, sensitive, willing to please and responsive to its family's wishes. It is not known for retaining its hunting instincts, but it is inquisitive and will appreciate a country outing.

The Akita's build reflects its original job of hunting big game through deep snow and rugged terrain.

Australian Cattle Dog,"The Australian Cattle Dog is of moderate build, enabling it to combine great endurance with bursts of speed and the extreme agility necessary in controlling unruly cattle. It is sturdy and compact, slightly longer than it is tall. Its gait is supple and tireless, and it must be capable of quick and sudden movement.

Its weather-resistant coat consists of a short, dense undercoat and moderately short, straight outer coat of medium texture.","Smart, hardy, independent, stubborn, tenacious, energetic and untiring — these are all traits essential to a driver of headstrong cattle, and all traits of the Australian cattle dog. This dog must have a job to do or it will expend its efforts on unacceptable jobs of its own. Given challenging mental and hard physical exercise daily, it is among the most responsive and obedient of dogs, an exemplary partner in adventure.

American Staffordshire Terrier,"This stocky dog should be muscular, giving the impression not only of great strength for its size but also of grace and agility. Its gait is springy.

At the same time, it is laid back-and easygoing, never on the lookout for trouble. It is suspicious of strangers and is territorial.

American Eskimo Dog,"The Eskie is built along classic Nordic lines, a form that has proved effective at pulling heavy loads through snow and ice. It is compactly built, slightly longer than tall. The stand-off, double coat resists soaking and provides insulation against the cold. The small thick ears are also cold-resistant. The breed's smaller size has moved it from the realm of sled dog, but it remains a sled dog in miniature. Its trot is agile and bold. The expression is keen and alert.","The American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively and fun-loving — in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion.

Afghan Hound,"The Afghan is built along greyhound-like lines, enabling it to execute a double-suspension gallop and run-down fleet game. The comparatively short back and steep pelvis helped it to leap great heights and to turn almost in place, essential attributes for coursing in rocky mountainous terrain. The large feet gave it a better foothold and were more resistant to injury on rough ground. The silky coat protected the dog from cold nights at high altitudes. The Afghan appears dignified and aloof, with an exotic expression and proud carriage. This dog's gait shows great elasticity and spring; the Afghan moves with its head and tail high.","Despite its glamorous reputation, the Afghan hound is a hunter at heart, bred to chase down game over rugged terrain. While it maintains its regal bearings inside, it needs a daily chance to stretch its legs in a safe area. Its worst trait is a reluctance to come when called. It will chase small animals outside; inside, it will coexist peacefully. Though gentle with children, it may not be playful and interactive enough with them. Described by some as ""catlike,"" it is independent yet sensitive and not overly demonstrative. It is reserved with strangers; some can be timid. It has a gay, clownish side.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/afghan-hound-2.jpg,Average $2500 - $3500 USD,Hypoallergenic: Yes

The ancestors of this breed were bred to hunt. The lack of coat makes the hairless variety unsuited for hunting, but both varieties still have a strong hunting instinct and the coated dogs are fearless, tenacious hunters with seemingly unlimited energy. The American Hairless Terrier is an exceptionally friendly companion, getting along well with children, other dogs, and even cats. American Hairless Terriers enjoy human companionship immensely and will enthusiastically share any activity with their owners. The hairless dogs require protection from the sun and winter cold weather. American Hairless Terriers should not be sparred during conformation judging.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/american-hairless-terrier-2.jpg,Average $2000 - $4000 USD,Hypoallergenic: Yes
Australian Terrier,"The Australian Terrier is small, sturdy and medium-boned; it is long in proportion to height.

Its weatherproof coat is made up of a short, soft undercoat and a harsh, straight, outer coat, about 2.5 inches long, shorter on the tail and lower legs. It sports a ruff around the neck and a topknot of longer hair adds to its keen, intelligent expression.","One of the quieter terriers, the Aussie is nonetheless a plucky, tough character, ready to go after a rodent when the chance arises. It is fun-loving and adventurous, and needs daily exercise to keep it from becoming frustrated. It is clever and generally eager to please, making it one of the more obedient terriers.

Keep in mind, these dogs are prey-driven and should always be walked on a leash. This hound needs a firm, but kind, hand for successful training.

Azawakh,"Morphology is very similar to that of the Middle Eastern and South Indian sight hounds, all swift, high-bred coursing hounds, although there are several obvious differences. For example, a short, flat back combined with long legs place the hips higher than the withers. The Azawakh is almond eyed and thin. It moves with a distinctly feline gait and can be found in a variety of colors as well as varying degrees of refinement, though format is basically constant. The standards call for a hound from 33 to 55 pounds (15 to 25 kg); its height is 24 to 29 inches (61 to 74 cm). The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are ""dry"", meaning that they are quite flat, unlike the Greyhound and Whippet. In this respect it is similar in type to the Saluki.","Relative to its native environment, the smooth-coated Azawakh hound mentally and structurally manifests his vocation as hunter, protector and companion. Quick, attentive, distant, proud and alert, he remains instinctively reserved with strangers and gentle with those he loves. Socialize well.

American Pit Bull Terrier,"The Pit Bull immediately strikes one as being a dog of power, passion and undying willingness. The brick-like head, which is especially broad between the cheeks (to house the powerful jaws), is carried upon a thickly muscled, well-defined neck. The neck runs into a deep, thick, well-sprung chest. The American Pit Bull is a very muscular, stocky, yet agile dog that is extremely strong for his size.The tail tapers to a point. The ears are generally cropped, though this is optional. Docked tails are not accepted by the UKC or the ADBA. The eyes are round. Both the ADBA and the UKC do not accept blue eyes or the coat color merle. The American Pitbull Registry does accept a merle coat. The teeth should form a scissors bite. Its coat is made up of thick, short, shiny hair. All colors are admissible. Shades of brown to red with a matching red/brown nose are referred to as red-nose Pit Bulls. Shades of gray with a matching gray nose are referred to as blue-nose Pit Bulls.","The essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed’s natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/american-pit-bull-terrier-2.jpg,Average $500 - $1000 USD,Hypoallergenic: No

The outline of the White Shepherd is made up of smooth curves rather than angles. Gender differences are readily apparent. The White Shepherd should be evaluated as an all-around working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they deviate from breed type; and how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work. Working dogs are not to be penalized under any conditions for scars or blemishes that are due to occupational injuries.","The White Shepherd has a distinct personality marked by self-confidence. The breed is poised, but when the situation demands, they are eager, alert and ready to serve in any capacity. White Shepherds demonstrate both herding and protective instincts.

They enjoy running, playing fetch or any activity with their human family. This is a joyful, active, intelligent and easy to train working dog with the ability to adapt and integrate to all kinds of social events and situations.

The chest is wide and well developed. It has a short, hard topcoat as well as undercoat. Coat colors come in red, black, brown, fawn, brindle or black/tan, with limited white markings common. The tail is docked or left-curled over the back.","The breed is described as ""a pleasant companion"" for rural and suburban areas. The breed standard describes the ideal Austrian Pinscher's temperament and character as playful, not inclined to be a hunter, and being an ""incorruptible guard"". Assertive, lively and alert, the breed is devoted to people it is familiar with and suspicious of strangers, making it a useful guard dog.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/austrian-pinscher-2.jpg,Average $400 - $600,Hypoallergenic: Unknown
Alaskan Husky,"The Alaskan Husky is not considered a pure breed. It is defined only by its purpose, which is that of a highly efficient sled dog. The husky is a blend of various Northern breeds, chosen particularly for skills such as pulling. Specializations in type exist within the category, such as freighting dogs (Mackenzie River husky, Malamute), sprint Alaskans (Eurohound), and distance Alaskans.","Alaskan Huskies are primarily bred as working dogs. They have greater endurance in sled racing than Siberian Huskies do. Gentle and playful, this cheerful dog is very fond of his or her family. A puppy at heart, they are clever, sociable and loving, easy-going and docile, though they do generally have a lot of energy, especially as puppies. Good with children and friendly with strangers, they are not watchdogs, for they bark little and love everyone. Huskies are very intelligent and trainable, but they have a mind of their own and will only obey a command if they see the point and if you do not display leadership, they will not see the point in obeying you. Training takes patience, consistency and an understanding of the Arctic dog character.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/alaskan-husky-2.jpg,Average $1000 - $1500 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
American Bulldog,"The American Bulldog is a powerful, athletic short-coated dog, strongly muscled, and well boned. The body is just slightly longer than tall. The head is large and broad, with a wide muzzle. Ears are small to medium in size, high set, and may be drop, semi-prick, rose, or cropped. The tail may be docked or natural. The American Bulldog comes in solid colors, white with colored patches, and brindle. Gender differences are well expressed in this breed, with males typically larger and more muscular than females. Honorable scars resulting from field work are not to be penalized. The American Bulldog should be evaluated as a working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.","The essential characteristics of the American Bulldog are those which enable it to work as a hog and cattle catching dog, and a protector of personal property. These tasks require a powerful, agile, confident dog with a large head and powerful jaws. The American Bulldog is a gentle, loving family companion who is fearless enough to face an angry bull or a human intruder. Note: It is common for young American Bulldogs to be somewhat standoffish with strangers, and judges should not penalize this. By the time the dog is around 18 months of age, however, the breed’s normal confidence asserts itself.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/american-bulldog-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $3500 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Andalusian Hound,"As in the Portuguese Podengo, the Andalusian Hound comes in three sizes (large, medium and small) and with three types of coat (wire-haired, long-haired and smooth). This combination of factors can results in nine different varieties. There is also a dwarf or basset variety derived from a medium-sized short-haired Andalusian Hound — called Maneto from its short, stout legs — which the RSCE has provisionally accepted as a distinct breed.","Andalusian Podencos, like other hounds, have excellent sight, hearing and smell, which makes them good hunters, often employed for hunting rabbits. Andalusians and mastiffs form the heart of the rehalas (teams of 20 to 24 hunting dogs) of central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula; medium and smaller dogs search out deer or wild boar, whilst the larger hounds are used for attacking the prey. One of the most typical functions of the large Andalusian hound was that of the so-called quitaor accompanying the Spanish Greyhound colleras during hare hunting. The quitaor‘s job consisted primarily of flushing out the hares from their home or hiding place and killing them; then, together with the Greyhounds, retrieving them for the owner. In Andalusian farmhouses the larger hounds were used as watchdogs, and the smaller hounds were used to kill rodents.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/andalusian-hound-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $2500 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
American Mastiff,"The American Mastiff has a much drier mouth than other Mastiffs. The drier mouth is due to outcrossing the English Mastiff with Anatolian Mastiff, which occurred early in the development of the breed. The American Mastiff is a large, massive and powerful dog. Temperament: Dignity rather than gaiety; quiet, calm, loving and loyal. Protective, but not aggressive.","The American Mastiff loves children and is totally devoted to its family. It is non-aggressive except in those instances when its family, especially the children, are threatened. In those instances it becomes a courageous defender. The American Mastiff is wise, kind and gentle, patient and understanding, very loving with its own people, neither shy nor vicious. It is loyal and devoted. Since these dogs are of the Mastiff type and grow to be very large, this breed should only be with an owner who knows how to display strong leadership.The objective in training this dog is to achieve pack leader status.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/american-mastiff-2.jpg,Average $1000 - $1500 USD,Hypoallergenic: Unknown
Akbash Dog,"The white Akbash Dog is a long-legged, lean, muscular dog of imposing size and strength, great courage, and stamina, with an alert, regal bearing. The Akbash Dog is slightly longer in proportion than tall, has a wedge-shaped head with pendant ears, and a long tail, usually carried in a curl over the back when the dog is moving or excited. The Akbash Dog represents a very rare and special mixture of Mastiff and gazehound characteristics that are important to maintain. The gazehound influence is apparent in the breed's long legs, deep chest, arched loin, shallow lower jaw, tucked up flank, speed, and agility, while the Mastiff's contributions can be seen in the breed's height, weight, broader head, and overall impression of power. When judging this breed, preference should be given to Akbash Dogs who exhibit a perfect balance between the two types.
Gender differences can be striking in this breed. Typically the dog is proportionately taller and heavier than the female. The bitch appears feminine in comparison to the dog. There is no difference in the ability of males or females to perform as guardians.","The essential characteristics of the Akbash Dog are those that enable it to perform successfully as a livestock guardian. Akbash Dogs have the size, strength, and courage to challenge large predators and the speed and agility to chase fleet predators. Their temperament is calm, quiet, and steady. They are independent and capable of correctly responding to changing circumstances without human direction. The Akbash Dog is also highly suitable as a home companion or estate guardian. The Akbash Dog is loyal, gentle, and quietly affectionate with its own family, including children and family pets, but remains aloof and suspicious toward strangers. It is also by nature watchful of other dogs and may, on its own territory, react aggressively to intruding dogs. Although independent in nature, the Akbash Dog responds well to basic training.

The skin is very thick, with neck folds and some wrinkles on the face.","Since the breed was used for hunting in packs, it is very sociable with other dogs.

A surprisingly deep, powerful voice and remarkable scenting ability. Of even temperament, essentially friendly and social.

It has sadly been established that this mutation can be associated with a dermoid sinus. Therefore, ‘ridged’ individuals are not recommended for breeding). There is also a wire-haired variety of the breed, but it is relatively rare. The height usually varies from 50 to 60 cm (with the tolerance of 2–3 cm).","The Africanis is well disposed without being obtrusive: a friendly dog showing watchful territorial behaviour.

American Staghound,"The American Staghound is not recognized as a breed, but is a type of sighthound that is used to pursue (course) a variety of quarry (game). Although it is not recognized as a breed, some ""lines"" have been bred together longer than some recognized modern breeds. The best way to visualize the American Staghound is to blend together the characteristics of the Scottish Deerhound with the Greyhound. This is a running dog with the physical characteristics that would be referred to as the Greyhound prototype. It has long legs, a deep chest and strong muscles. The Staghound has great visual acuity, and some have been bred for some scenting ability while on course. It can be found in any assortment of color or color patterns that can be found on the Greyhound and Scottish Deerhound. There are three coat types: the ""shag,"" which more closely resembles the Scottish Deerhound; the ""slick,"" which more closely resembles the Greyhound; and the “broken,” which is in between the two. The American Staghound has all of the physical and mental characteristics needed for running down its quarry. It is known for having speeds that approach that of a Greyhound, but unlike a Greyhound, some specimens have incredible endurance.","American Staghounds are generally gentle, calm and affectionate with their family.  Due to the American Staghound's hunting heritage, the breed usually does poorly as guard dogs as the American Staghound is seldom territorial.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/american-staghound-2.jpg,Average (Unknown),Hypoallergenic: Unknown
Alopekis,"Alopekis populations existed until recently all over Greece and some of their traditional uses were ratting and the extermination of mice and other small vermin, as well as protection of poultry, such as domestic chickens and ducks from the attacks of foxes; the small dogs can easily fit in the hen coops and curl up inside to spend the night on vigil against their namesake intruder; they also co-operate very well with the bigger flock- guardians and sheepdogs in the farm and on the field. The breed is an excellent and brave little watchdog and quite strong for its size. Before the mass importation of foreign breeds to Greece that started in the 1970s and '80s, the undisputed majority of small dogs in urban and rural areas were mostly Alopekis and Melieo Kynidio or Kokoni.","The Alopekis as a house companion is very affectionate, reliable, devoted, lively, active but not highly-strung nor yappy dog. The typical temperament is confident, outgoing, sociable, happy and very easy to train. Protective and caring towards the other house pets or animals, yet a determined enemy of vermin, a very diligent little worker, a capable hunter and retriever of game and quite playful. The breed is very good with children. As a utility dog and watchdog the Alopekis is courageous, vigilant, alert, spirited and able to cover the distance tirelessly, athletic and with very quick reflexes.

Beagle,"The Beagle should look like a miniature foxhound, solid for its size. The beagle's moderate size enables it to be followed on foot.

Its moderate build enables it to nimbly traverse rough terrain. The beagle's amiable personality allows it to get along with other dogs and to be a successful pack hunter. The beagle is noted for its melodious bay, which helps hunters locate it from a distance.","One of the most amiable hounds, the beagle was bred as a pack hunter and needs companionship, whether human or canine. It loves to explore the outdoors and is an enthusiastic trailer. Given adequate exercise, it is a calm, tractable house pet.

Bernese Mountain Dog,"The Bernese Mountain Dog is slightly longer than tall, though it appears square. It is a sturdy, large, hardy dog capable of both draft and droving work. This requires a combination of strength, speed and agility. Its natural working gait is a slow trot, but with good reach and drive. Its thick coat is moderately long, and slightly wavy or straight, providing insulation from the cold. Its expression is gentle, and its coloring is striking.","The Bernese mountain dog is an easygoing, calm family companion (that is, after it leaves its adolescent stage).

Brittany,"The leggiest of the sporting breeds, the Brittany is square-proportioned, the height at the shoulder equaling the length of the body. It stands slightly higher at the withers than at the rump. It is medium-sized with light bone. The combination of long legs and light bones endows the Brittany with remarkable agility and speed. In fact, the breed is very quick and is noted for its ground-covering side movement at the trot. The Brittany may be born tailless or have the tail docked to about 4 inches. The breed's coat is far less profuse than that of spaniels and is either flat or wavy. An overly profuse coat is detrimental when hunting in briars and is considered a severe fault. The Brittany's expression is alert and eager, but soft. The eyes are protected from briars by a fairly heavy eyebrow. The Brittany is an extremely athletic, eager dog that should be ready and able to run in the field for extended periods.","In temperament, the Brittany is friendly and eager to please. These friendly little dogs hunt more like a Setter due to their pointing ability, and are higher on their legs than other Spaniels. The Brittany does not require a heavy hand in training. In fact, they may quit if the discipline is too stern. Much more is accomplished with a gentle hand. They seek human attention, which makes them easier to train than some other hunting breeds.

Border collies must be able to display incredible agility even after working for long periods. The coat can be either smooth or rough. The smooth coat is short all over the body; the rough coat is medium to long in length and flat to slightly wavy in texture. Its expression is intelligent, alert, eager and full of interest, a reflection of its temperament.","The Border Collie is a bundle of mental and physical energy awaiting its chance to be unleashed on the world. Among the most intelligent and obedient of breeds, it is nonetheless a disastrous house dog if it is not given a challenging job every day.

Basset Hound,"The Basset's long, heavy body and short legs make it easy to follow on foot and give it an edge in dense cover. The basset hound has heavier bone, in proportion to its total size, than any other breed. Its thick, tight coat protects it from brambles without becoming caught in them. It is speculated that its long ears may stir up ground scent, and the wrinkles trap the scent around the face. The large muzzle gives ample room for the olfactory apparatus. Such room would not be available in a miniature dog; only a large dog with shortened legs can combine the short height with large muzzle size. The basset's movement is smooth and powerful; it tends to move with nose to the ground.","The Basset Hound is among the most good-natured and easygoing of breeds. It is amiable with dogs, other pets and children, although children must be cautioned not to put strain on its back with their games. It is calm inside, but it needs regular exercise to keep fit.

Belgian Malinois,"The Belgian Malinois is a sturdy dog of square proportion with moderately heavy, but oval, bone. It is elegant, with very proud head carriage.

The Malinois has a tendency to run in a wide circle rather than a straight line. Its coat is fairly short, straight, and hard, with a dense undercoat. Its expression is intelligent and questioning.","Intense best describes the Belgian Malinois. This is a high-energy breed with a need for regular mental and physical stimulation. It is alert, smart and serious, an ideal watchdog and guard dog. It is aloof with strangers and can be aggressive toward other dogs and animals. Some can be domineering.

Its soft, inquisitive expression enabled it to worm its way into many hearts and laps.","Bichons love to show off, and they respond well to positive training but not harsh tactics. The Bichon is a naturally gentle, playful dog. Attending an obedience class will benefit both pet and owner. He loves activity and requires regular exercise. Highly intelligent and trainable, Bichons delight in entertaining their owners. Bichons also love to run - and they are fast! Your first ‘Bichon blitz’ will amaze you.

Bloodhound,"The Bloodhound is a steadfast trailer, built for endurance rather than speed. Its skin is thin and loose, falling in wrinkles around its head and throat. Its long ears are supposed to stir up scents as the ears rake along the ground, and its profuse wrinkles are said to trap the odors around the face, although neither of these assertions has ever been scientifically verified. Its dense short coat protects it from being caught in brambles. Its docile temperament makes it nonthreatening to the humans it is sometimes now called upon to trail. Its gait is elastic and free, with tail held high. Its expression is noble and dignified.","For all its calm manners at home, the bloodhound is a tireless trailer once on the track. It is tough, stubborn and independent, yet it is so gentle and placid that it is extremely trustworthy around children — although it may not be playful enough for some children's needs. Nonetheless, it is not the lazy ol' hound dog portrayed in folklore but instead an active, playful companion. Although not the easiest breed to train for traditional obedience, it is exceptionally easy to train in tasks involving trailing.

Bullmastiff,"This nearly square breed should be powerful and active — a combination of strength, endurance and alertness. It should appear to be 60 percent mastiff and 40 percent bulldog. Its gait is smooth and powerful, but its angulation is moderate. Its coat is short and dense, and its expression keen and alert. These attributes allowed the bullmastiff to both overtake and over-power intruders.","The Bullmastiff is innately good-natured, calm, easygoing and surprisingly gentle.

Bull Terrier,"The Bull Terrier is the cavalier gladiator — a good-looking tough character. It is strongly built and muscular, longer than it is tall. Its muscle mass combined with its relatively low center of gravity make it difficult for opponents to knock it off its feet. Its distinctive head not only shows off its keen and determined expression, but also its great jaw strength. Its gait is smooth and easy. Its skin is tight, and its coat short, flat and harsh.","Exuberant, comical, playful, assertive and very mischievous describes the bull terrier. It is an imaginative breed that often sees things its own way and is stubborn to the end. It needs daily physical and mental exercise lest it exercise its powerful jaws on your home.

Basenji,"The Basenji is square-proportioned and high on leg. It is far more slightly built and longer-legged than most other primitive breeds, giving it a good amount of speed and the ability to perform the double-suspension gallop. Its erect ears help it locate prey in thick bush and may act as heat dissipaters. Its short coat also aids in dealing with the hot climate of Africa.","Some consider the basenji to have terrier-like mannerisms because it is feisty for a hound. More often it is considered catlike in mannerisms: clever, inquisitive, stubborn, independent and reserved. Its hunting roots are very evident, as it loves to chase and trail. It needs regular mental and physical stimulation, lest it become frustrated and destructive. Basenjis may be barkless, but they are not mute. They do make a sort of yodel, howl and shriek — and occasionally bark, but just one or two ""fox barks"" at a time.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/basenji-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $2000 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Boykin Spaniel,"Boykin Spaniels are medium-sized spaniels, larger and rangier than American Cocker Spaniel but more compact than English Springer Spaniel.

Bred to work the lakes and swamps of their native South Carolina, web-toed Boykins can swim like seals.","The Boykin Spaniel is an obedient breed that is eager to please.

As such, it retains the greyhound build necessary for running at great speed, but it is larger and stronger than the greyhound. Its jaws should be strong enough to hold down a wolf. The long, silky coat, which can be either flat, wavy or rather curly, provides protection against cold weather and snow. Borzois should possess elegance and grace, with flowing lines, whether standing or moving.","A breed of quiet elegance, the borzoi exemplifies the well-mannered house dog. Outdoors, it races with wild abandon, and it will chase any small animal that runs. It is independent but very sensitive.

The head is not held high when moving, but is lowered to the level of the back, as is typical of herding dogs. Its outer coat is straight, dense, and coarse, of medium length; this, combined with a dense undercoat, offers weather-resistant protection. An unusual trait is the presence of double dewclaws on the hindlegs, which seem to be a French tradition for herding and flock dogs. Although they serve no function, they were perhaps at one time associated with the best herders, and are now a breed trademark.","Beaucerons are uncannily intelligent and adept at any task involving learning, memory, and reasoning. They are courageous and calm, and make reliable, thoughtful guardians. This is an extremely loyal breed that is eager to please its family; however, if not properly trained, the Beauceron can run the family.

The word Boerboel means ""Farm Dog"" and it serves as a capable working dog as well as a loyal companion in its home country of South Africa. The skin of a Boerboel should be dark on his stomach and under his fur, as well as the roof of his mouth, which protects against heat and sun. The coat is short, dense coat can be brindle, brown, cream, reddish brown or tawny.","The Boerboel is self assured and fearless. It is highly devoted to family and affectionate with children it knows, but can be aggressive toward strangers.

The beardie's expression is bright and inquiring.","The boisterous beardie is lively and playful, full of enthusiasm and energy.

The weatherproof outercoat repels water while the undercoat insulates the dog from the cold. Length of coat should vary from 1.5 inches to 4 inches with longer coats detracting from the dog's working ability.","Calm, confident and courageous sums up the Black Russian Terrier. Reserved with strangers, BRTs are very attached to and protective of their family. They are fast learners, but also independent thinkers, and they can be stubborn if pushed to do something they don't want to do. BRTs are affectionate and social.

Athletic and hardy, Blueticks are working dogs that need a job - such as hunting, obedience or agility - to stay happy. Living with a Bluetick can be very rewarding or very frustrating.

It is companionable, demonstrative and loyal. It enjoys its creature comforts and is a fairly quiet house dog. Even though it will seldom initiate a fight, it will not allow itself to be intimidated by other dogs and can be a scrappy fighter when pushed.

Berger Picard,"The Berger Picard is a medium-sized, well-muscled dog, slightly longer than tall, with a distinctive rough coat, erect ears, and a natural tail that normally reaches to the hock and is carried with a slight J-curve at the tip.

By and large, Picards are laid back and mellow but they are known for having a stubborn streak and being reserved towards strangers. They require a lot of socialization during the first two years of their lives. Picards are energetic and hard working, alert and are not excessive barkers. Some Picards are notoriously picky eaters, and it may be difficult to decide on a diet that you and the dog agree on. The breed also has a well-developed sense of humor, making them an endearing companion, and they continue to be used very effectively as both sheep and cattle herder in their native land and elsewhere. Like many herding breeds, Picards require human companionship and lots of it.

Wire-coated, the coat is very harsh to the touch, dense, red-wheaten or fawn. He measures 32 – 38 cm in height and weighs between 36 - 40 lbs but due the old, and no longer permitted, practice of registering mixed litters of Griffon and Basset Fauves sometimes a litter of bassets will produce a long legged dog more akin to the Griffon. They have coarse, dense fur which may require stripping. The hair on the ears is shorter, finer and darker than that on the coat. The ears just reach the end of the nose rather than trailing on the ground and should be pleated. They should have dark eyes and nose and ideally no crook on the front legs. The French standard says these are the shortest backed of all the basset breeds so they generally do not appear as exaggerated as the British Basset.","Smart, courageous and determined, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a serious hunter, easily adapting to different types of game or terrain.

Bracco Italiano,"The Bracco - or Italian Pointer- should be athletic and powerful in appearance, most resembling a cross between a German Shorthaired Pointer and a Bloodhound, although it is nothing like them in character. It has pendulous upper lips and long ears that create a serious expression. It should be ""almost square"", meaning that its height at the withers should be almost the same as the length of its body. It should not however be actually square as this would render its famous rear driving push off and front/rear extension to be compromised, thus losing much of its powerful grace. The tail can be docked, mostly due to the strong possibility of injury in rough/dense terrain when hunting, however there has been a sea-change in Italy, with some now working the breed with full tail.","Braccos are very much a people-loving dog and thrive on human companionship, having a strong need to be close to their people. They are a particularly good family dog, and many have a strong love of children. They get along well with other dogs and pets, if trained to do so - it is, afterall, a hunting breed - and must be taught what to chase and what not to. They are very willing to please as long as they have decided that your idea is better than theirs. Obedience training is a must for a Bracco, and the more is asked of them, the better they do. Harsh reprimands do not work with this breed unless the reprimand is a fair one - and harshness must occasionally be used with some dogs to remind them who is actually in charge. Although not an aggressive breed, many Braccos will alert if there is a reason, and some will bark or growl if there's a good reason. The breed loves to hunt, and they excel at it - in fact, a non-hunting Bracco is not a happy Bracco, and will act out in various other ways. Hunting without a gun (as in NAVHDA - this group does not even allow a handler to carry a gun during trials) is an area in which the Bracco can excel and this can be a great opportunity for training the dog to connect with the owner. They are an active breed, but require more mental exercise than physical exercise to keep them happy. A Bracco owner can teach games like hide-and-seek (an object or person) which fits into the breed's original and current usage, and keeps them mentally active.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/bracco-italiano-2.jpg,Average $2000 - $2500 USD,Hypoallergenic: Unknown

Cockapoo,"The Cockapoo is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Cocker Spaniel and the Poodle.

Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses. Note: some Cockapoo clubs are working toward making the Cockapoo a purebred dog by multi-generation crossing, while other breeders are sticking to the basic Poodle / Cocker mix, stating they wish to preserve the heterosis effect in the hybrid mix. Ask the breeder you contact which type of Cockapoo they are breeding.","Cockapoos have become popular because they generally combine the outgoing, loving personality of the Cocker Spaniel with the low-shedding, low-dander qualities of the Poodle. Cockapoos are active, and thrive when they receive regular exercise. Cockapoos can be very agile, excelling at ""retrieve"" games and enjoying activities such as swimming. Cockapoos are frequently very needy dogs and as such are not suitable to be left alone for long periods as they frequently suffer from separation distress or anxiety. The Cockapoo is a cross-breed, not a purebred, and does not ""breed true."" In breeders' terms, ""breeding true"" means that the pups will have consistently predictable characteristics. Cockapoos, however, may inherit the characteristics of either or both their parent breeds. While some Cockapoos appear more similar to Cocker Spaniels, others will exhibit more Poodle traits, creating a variation in Cockapoo appearance and temperament.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/cockapoo-2.jpg,Average $1000 - $2000,Hypoallergenic: No

Carolina Dog,"The Carolina Dog is a dog of medium build, possessing the general appearance of a small jackal or wolf in combination with many features of a small Sighthound.

The dog typically has a medium-length straight back, with a distinctive waist which sets off a deep brisket from a highly tucked-up loin. The tail is distinctive in both its fish-hook-like configuration and its variable carriage, depending on mood. The medium to large, usually upright ears and long, graceful neck are also distinctive and suggest the appearance of a small, versatile and resourceful predator, well adapted to surviving on its own in a natural habitat. In ideal conditions, a Carolina Dog should appear thin and tight. It is not inappropriate, for example, for the ribs to show slightly as in a well-conditioned racing sighthound. Individuals that are greatly overweight should be severely penalized. The dog is to be shown in a natural condition, with little or no evidence of grooming or scissoring. Whiskers are not to be removed.","Carolina Dogs are natural runners. They have excellent noses that help them hunt wild animals, when in the wild.

Because of the breed’s name, many people assume that all Catahoulas have the so-called “leopard” markings and blue eyes. In fact, the breed is noted for its many and unusual coat colors and patterns, as well as varied eye color. The Catahoula should be evaluated as a multi-purpose working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.","Catahoulas are highly intelligent and energetic.

The head is covered with soft, silky hair, lending to the appearance of a large head. The topknot also enhances the expression, which is determined, dignified, soft and wise.","The Dandie Dinmont is no ""dandified"" dog; it is rough-and-tumble and ready for the hunt. Yet it functions well as a dignified house pet, affectionate but not doting. It is a loyal companion suitable for people of all ages, but it does need daily exercise to keep it from becoming frustrated. It is intelligent and very independent.

Dingo,"The 'Dingo"" (Canis dingo) is a wild canine found in Australia. Its exact ancestry is unknown, but dingoes are classified as their own unique canine species. The dingo is the largest terrestrial predator in Australia, and plays an important role as an apex predator. However, the dingo is seen as a pest by livestock farmers due to attacks on animals. Conversely, their predation on rabbits, kangaroos and rats may be of benefit to graziers.","The Dingo has intense eyes that vary in color from yellow to orange. The very mobile, small, rounded ears are naturally erect. The well furred, appearing bushy, tail is relaxed and has good length. The hindquarters are lean and muscular. The coat is soft.

Drever,"The Drever's most noticeable characteristic are its long body and short legs, inherited from the Westphalian Dachsbracke, but as a working dog these features are not exaggerated. It has short fur, and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which has been linked to deafness.) The breed has the typical drop (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of a Drever is 38 cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15 cm (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the same size body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2 cm (less than an inch) shorter than the Drever.","Alert, calm, friendly and even, the Drever is known for the ongoing slight wag of his tail. The Drever often wants to continue working long after its human companion has satisfied his own hunting instinct. It has a first-class nose and is a powerful tracker. Because of its short legs, it is slower than other hounds. This makes it ideal for maneuvering game toward the hunter's gun. The Drever is a steady worker that hunts hare, fox, and occasionally deer; but this dog has the courage to pit himself against even a wild boar. In such cases, he circles and dodges the prey, warning the hunter by barking furiously. The Drever has an excellent nose and a musical voice which is much larger than his size would seem to warrant. The Drever was bred to be tenacious on the hunt and therefore it is very important that the owners of this breed are just as stern when dealing with him in order to show him where his place is among his human pack. Owners who are determined and consistent with the rules, displaying a natural firm but not harsh authority over the dog will bring out the best in this breed. Passive owners will find the dog to become stubborn and headstrong. Drevers that lack in mental and physical exercise and/or leadership will develop quirks in their temperament.

The expression — alert, kindly and trusting — is an essential feature of springer type.","Friendly, affectionate and easily trained. These qualities are essential when being trained for the field or shown in the ring. The Springer’s long ears, soft expression and happy disposition clearly show him to be a member of the ancient family of spaniels. It is uncharacteristic for a gun dog to be aggressive towards other dogs or people, therefore aggression is unacceptable behavior.

The English cocker has a driving, powerful gait that covers ground effortlessly. The coat is of medium length, silky in texture and either flat or slightly wavy. The feathering should not be so profuse that it becomes a hindrance in the field, but it should be long enough to protect the underside of the dog. The expression is soft and melting, yet dignified.","The English Cocker Spaniel is merry, affectionate and even-tempered. They are easily-trained, are willing workers and excellent companions. They exhibit enthusiasm in the field, accompanied by an incessant action of the tail. Dogs exhibiting sluggish or hyper-active temperaments are to be faulted. They exhibit balance, both in motion and while standing. The head is especially characteristic of the breed, having a brainy appearance indicating high intelligence. The muzzle is also distinctive.

Its markings are distinctive, consisting of flecks of color, sometimes with patches, on a white background. The combination of good looks and hunting ability make the English setter a perfect gentleman's hunting companion. The Laveracks tend to be larger, carry more feathering, often have deeper muzzles and usually hold their tails nearly level when on point. The Llewellins tend to be smaller and faster, with less coat and often larger patches of color. They tend to hold their tails straight up when on point.","Bred to cover a lot of area when hunting, the English Setter is a lively dog that loves to hunt and run. This is especially true of dogs from field lines. If not given sufficient exercise, they can be overly lively inside. With daily exertion, however, they are calm and tractable house dogs.

Bred to move cattle up and down sloping pastures, Entles are famous for agility, balance, and rugged determination.","They may be reserved with strangers. Entles are an active, high energy and physical breed, with above average exercise requirements, so they are not a dog for the casual owner. Entlebuchers do best when they have a job. Although the Entlebucher loves and is devoted to children, his shepherding instincts can make integrating small children and a puppy a bit tricky. The Young Entle can become possessive and begin to consider children to be “his own” to herd and watch over. Being exceptionally strong for his size, the Entle can easily overwhelm a child.

The coat is medium length and can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is frequently feathering on the legs and tail, as well as on the ear. As a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed quite a lot and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting.

However, once he accepts people or children or stock as his own, there are few better caretakers than an English Shepherd. The English Shepherd frequently exhibits an independent, bossy or ""enforcer of the rules"" streak in his temperament.

The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the Eurasier's neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue.","Eurasiers are calm, even-tempered dogs. They are watchful and alert, yet reserved towards strangers without being timid or aggressive. Eurasiers form a strong link to their families. For the full development of these qualities, the Eurasier needs constant close contact with its family, combined with understanding, yet consistent, training. They are extremely sensitive to harsh words or discipline and respond best to soft reprimand. The Eurasier is a combination of the best qualities of the Chow Chow, the Keeshond, and the Samoyed (dog), resulting in a dignified, intelligent breed. Eurasiers were bred as companion dogs; as such they do poorly in a kennel environment such as those commonly used for institutionally trained service dogs, nor are they well suited for the social stresses of working as a sled or guard dog. Training should always be done through family members, not through strangers or handlers. Eurasiers should never be restricted to only a yard, kennel, crate, or chained up. They would pine and become depressed. Within these limitations, Eurasiers can work very well as therapy dogs.

Another typical characteristic of the breed is its gait, which is similar to that of a camel, moving two legs of one side at a time. The gait gives it a typical rolling lateral movement on the throat and the hindquarters which is accentuated when the dog's tail is raised. The head is typically lower than the backline. The characteristic carriage and gait has earned it great success in dog shows.","The Brazilian Mastiffs are known to be naturally protective. It is also known for its extreme wariness of strangers and agility when protecting or defending its master. The dedication and obedience of the Fila Brasileiro has found its way into Brazilian saying ""As faithful as a Fila"". The Fila Brasileiro temperament is what characterizes the dog. The Portuguese word for their temperament is Ojeriza, which directly translated into English means dislike and distrust. The socialization period (about the first year with the first 6-8 months being the most important) of the dog's life is crucial to the temperament of the individual dog. If the pup is exposed to a lot of people in a positive manner (known as 'socializing'), the pup (keeping in mind the dog's natural protective instincts) can be encouraged to behave in a calm manner in public, but emphasis should be placed on the fact that socialization is done differently from other breeds. Despite extensive socialization, the fila is instinctively protective and will naturally guard and protect its owner, their family members and the family pets; this is not something that needs to be trained, it is an innate trait. Strangers should not be left unattended with a Fila and, like all other guardian breeds, it may not be the best choice for those who have frequent visitors to their homes. Lack of all socialization with strangers at a young age will result in a dog which is very anti-social.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/fila-brasileiro-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $2000 USD,Hypoallergenic: No

Irish Red and White Setter,"Sportsmen thrill at the sight of a noble Irish Red and White Setter frozen on point, motionless as a statue. These medium-to-large bird dogs are powerful, solid, and sinewy, with enough stamina and bird sense to get the job done any day of the week and twice on Sunday. The stunning coat—vivid red “islands” floating on a sea of pearl white—has a practical function: It enables hunters to spot their dog at a distance. The handsome face projects a keen but kindly expression.","The Irish Red and White setter can be the most devoted and affectionate of dogs making them ideal all-round family dogs. They are extremely intelligent and respond well to proper training but they do need to have plenty to occupy them. They thrive best in active families, where they have outlets for their high energy, and require space to run freely. Young puppies do not require much exercise but once they reach maturity the breed's working instincts mean they require enough space to be able to run hard and fast for a long distance. Setters are usually good natured, very gentle and get on well with children and other dogs.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/irish-red-and-white-setter-2.jpg,Average $1800 - $2500 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Ibizan Hound,"The Ibizan Hound should possess deer-like elegance and expression, and its movement should reflect these qualities. Its lithe build enables it to perform the double-suspension gallop with great speed, agility and endurance. It is a superb jumper, able to spring to great heights from a standstill. It is racy, slightly longer than tall. With the exception of its large ears, it should not be exaggerated in any way. The trot is light and graceful. The coat can be hard, either short or wire — the latter should be from 1 to 3 inches in length.","The graceful Ibizan hound retains great hunting instinct, using its acute senses of hearing and smell to locate small animals, and relishing the opportunity to chase anything that moves.

Irish Water Spaniel,"The Irish Water Spaniel is built like no other spaniel, being much taller and racier. The body is of medium length, the whole dog being slightly rectangular in appearance. The general appearance suggests both dash and endurance. The gait is smooth and ground-covering. The coat is one of the breed's distinctive features. The body is covered with a double coat consisting of crisp ringlets. This combination imparts water, weather and thorn resistance to the dog, enabling it to hunt in the harshest of conditions. The Irish water spaniel's expression says it all: alert, intelligent and quizzical.","Like most dogs of the American Kennel Club Sporting group, the Irish Water Spaniel is essentially an active, willing and energetic companion. Because it has been bred from stock used to fetch game and return it to hand without a fuss, it has the natural instinct of wanting to please. Its keen sense of working as a team makes it a relatively easy dog to train and discipline. Because of its great intelligence and quizzical nature, it has the reputation of being the clown of the spaniel family and will do ordinary things in extraordinary ways to achieve that which is asked of it. Some individual dogs can be very wary of strangers and not every IWS can be trusted to get along with other pets.

Its weatherproof coat may be smooth, broken or rough and is predominantly white with tan and/or black markings.","The Jack Russell Terrier is a bold, friendly, active and alert hunting terrier, built for work underground. This breed is notoriously fearless and requires little encouragement to go to ground. Aggression towards anything other than legitimate quarry detracts from the dog’s ability as a working terrier, and should be discouraged as much as possible.

The overall appearance is one of Oriental aristocracy.","The Japanese Chin is a devoted companion, relishing a warm lap as much as a boisterous game.

The large oval (akin to a ginkgo seed) eyes are dark and slightly slanted with white eyelashes, and the nose and lips and eye rims are black. The face of the Japanese Spitz is wedge-shaped. They share a common resemblance with the white Pomeranian dog, Samoyed and American Eskimo Dog.","Active, loyal, and bright, the Japanese Spitz are known for their great courage, affection and devotion making them great watchdogs and ideal companions for older people and small children. Most Japanese Spitz are good watch dogs, despite their relatively small size, and they have a tendency to bark to warn of arriving strangers. The Japanese Spitz is first and foremost a companion dog and thrives on human contact and attention, preferring to be a member of the family. They are known as very loyal dogs. They enjoy being active and love to be in the outdoors. They are intelligent, playful, alert, and obedient, and particularly excellent and loving toward children. Unlike many other dogs, the Japanese Spitz will customarily have his or her tail flipped onto its back.

Jagdterrier,"The Jagdterrier is first and foremost a hunting and sporting dog. Jagdterriers possess a spirit of liveliness and speed at work, yet are regal at rest. ""Alert,"" ""athletic"" and ""active"" describes the ambience of the Jagdterrier. A bit of fire is always evident in its expression. Physically, individuals should exhibit a square (though not broad) build, standing squarely and true over the feet. A deep and narrow chest allows the dog to easily enter dens. Leg length is in proportion to the rest of the body, avoiding both stubbiness or legginess. The tail is set fairly high and straight, and is gaily carried. The tail posture, while the dog is working, will be wayward and is not important. Though cropped, the remaining tail must be long enough to serve as a handle, should the hunter need to pull the terrier from a den. The coat may be either harsh or smooth; the important factor for coats of working terriers being that the coat must be thick and ample for turning briars and fangs.","This terrier breed is a clever hunter, unrelenting, tough, and robust. The Jagdterrier is unafraid of the most formidable wild game and very intent in the pursuit of such game. The breed is highly intelligent and affable with its master and other hunters. Considering its determination to work, and its combustible energy, the breed should not be selected strictly as a pet, though they are totally people friendly. Dash, gameness and pluck are all descriptive of a properly bred Jagdterrier.

Kooikerhondje,"The Kooikerhondje is a small, flashy, orange and white spaniel-like sporting dog.

He will not always immediately like strangers, instead choosing to retreat. But once he warms up to someone, the trust will be there for the rest of his life. The Kooikerhondje can make a fine apartment dog if exercised regularly, but a fenced yard will be more ideal.

Its double coat is medium-coarse, ranging from wavy to straight.","Despite its sweet looks, the kuvasz is a tough protector, fearlessly defending its family or home. It is gentle with and protective of children in its own family, but it may misinterpret a child's rough-and-tumble games with other children as attacks on its child.

Honorable scars or other evidences of injury resulting from working in the field are not to be penalized.","The Karelian Bear Dog has a reserved but stable temperament and is very devoted to its master.

A latter-day Norfolk Terrier mated with a latter-day Sealyham Terrier does not produce a Lucas Terrier because it will not trace back to the original Lucas Terrier lines. All true Lucas Terriers have a direct connection to Sir Jocelyn Lucas's original Ilmer Kennel based Lucas Terriers. The Lucas Terrier is bred primarily for temperament and companionship, and so should be friendly, with no aggressive tendencies towards people or other dogs, and not fearful or nervous while retaining the usual terrier traits.

There is also a longhaired variety.","Temperament is also variable, again dependent on parental influence. As could be expected, lurchers with dominant sighthound attributes have similar temperaments—often fairly lazy with a good eye—however, accordingly, others are influenced by their other, often more tractable, biddable, and slower parent.

Their powerful yet compact build enables them to rush around tirelessly, leaping and retrieving with tail always wagging. The jaws are strong enough to carry a duck. Because they were bred to work in icy waters, they have a water-repelling double coat of medium length. A longer coat is not appropriate for a working dog, although the tail feathering should be long, adding to the emphasis of the wagging tail.

This combination presents the best protection against cold and snow.","The Norwegian Elkhound combines traits of hounds and spitz-like dogs, resulting in a breed that is bold, playful, independent, alert, boisterous and — unlike most hounds — even protective.

Today, they are also trained to aid the hearing impaired, perform some types of police work, and perform in obedience and agility trials. Their thick coat is wheaten (pale cream to bright orange) or black in color.","While Norwegian Buhunds make excellent watch dogs, they are also content to lie at your feet at the end of a hard day. Training wise, the Buhund is considered by many to be the most trainable of the Spitz breeds, but obedience training is still a necessity. Because the Buhund was born to herd and sound the alarm, the Buhund needs training and a job to do.

Their dense coat ranges from fallow to reddish brown to tan in color, with black hair tips and white markings, or white with red or dark markings.","Their superior personality, even disposition and small size make them an ideal, easy-to-live-with pet, although they may be wary of strangers. Consistency in the home environment is extremely important, as is consistency in training, house training, and socialization.

In proportions the Norrbottenspets is slightly taller than long - fit for the original use as a hunter. The tail should curl over the back and rest on the hips.","The Norrbottenspets is a physical mixture of endurance, speed, and strength. The ribcage has elements of both speed and strength. Viewed from the front the ribcage is oval and relatively deep, half from height. The ribcage is also relatively long with well-developed last ribs. The arched neck, distinguishable withers and slightly slanting croup makes the lines of the body very speedy.

The owner of a Northern Inuit must show themselves to be a strong leader or be prepared to be the underdog, and be taken advantage of. They are more difficult to train than other, more biddable breeds. Separation anxiety may arise when they are left alone and unsupervised too long, leading to destructive behaviours but training to be left from a young age will rectify this. Training from the onset is a must for this breed. Often, they will do better with another dog for company.

Although gentle and affectionate with people they know, they can be aloof with strangers. NGSDs can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially of the same sex. Its howl has an eerie yet synchronized quality, which gives the breed its name. The howl can be spurred when the dog is disturbed or excited.

Scottish Terrier,"The Scottish Terrier is a short-legged, compact, relatively heavy-boned dog, giving the impression of great power in a small package. This combination is essential in a dog that must meet tough adversaries in tight spaces. Its coat is a combination of dense undercoat and extremely hardy and wiry outer coat, about 2 inches in length. The distinctive eyebrows and beard add to its expression, which is keen and sharp.","Nicknamed the Diehard in reference to its rugged character, the Scottish terrier is a tough, determined character, ready for action. It is fearless and feisty and may be aggressive toward other dogs and animals. It is reserved, but friendly, with strangers, and devoted to its family.

Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier,"The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is an all-around dog, square-proportioned, graceful and strong, not exaggerated in any way. It is large enough to function as a general farm worker yet agile enough to perform its job as vermin exterminator. Its gait is free and lively with good reach and drive; the tail held erect. Its abundant, soft, single coat distinguishes it from all other terriers. It is long and silky with a gentle wave. The overall appearance is one of grace and strength in an alert and happy dog.","The Wheaten makes a playful companion at home and a fun-loving partner in the field.

Shar-Pei,"The Shar-Pei is compact and square, with a head slightly large for its body. Its signature wrinkles enabled it to twist away when grabbed by a dog when in a fight. Its stiff bristly coat further afforded protection against bites. The coat can be of either brush (not to exceed 1 inch) or horse (very short) types, both should be extremely harsh, straight and stand off the body. The small, close ears and small, sunken eyes afford further protection. The gait is free, with good reach and drive. The wide, powerful jaws, scowling expression and hippopotamus muzzle create a look unique to the breed.","The Shar-Pei is self-assured, serious, independent, stubborn and very much self-possessed. Although not particularly demonstrative, it is devoted and very protective of its family. It is reserved, even suspicious, toward strangers. It can be aggressive toward other dogs and may chase livestock and other animals, although it is generally good with other family pets. The Shar-Pei needs daily mental and physical stimulation, but its needs can be met with lively games throughout the day or a good long walk. It is not generally amenable to exclusive outdoor living, but it can divide its time between house and yard. The coat needs only weekly brushing, but wrinkles need regular attention to ensure that no irritations develop within the skin folds.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/shar-pei-2.jpg,Average $1000 - $1500 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Staffordshire Bull Terrier,"The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is slightly longer than it is tall, and relatively wide, giving it a low center of gravity and firm stance. Its small size imparts a surprising agility, while its heavy musculature provides great strength. The wide head provides ample room for attachment of jaw muscles. Its gait should be powerful and agile. Its coat is smooth, short and close.","The Staffordshire bull terrier is a fun-loving character that loves playing with its family and friends. It is typically playful, companionable, amiable, docile and generally responsive to its owner's wishes. Its love of a good game is rivaled only by its need for human companionship. It is also characteristically friendly toward strangers. Some can be strong-willed. Although it doesn't usually look for a fight, it is fearless and tenacious. It may not do well around strange dogs or sometimes even household dogs that challenge it. It is generally very good with children; although usually gentle, some can be rambunctious.

Its hallmark whiskers, mustache and eyebrows add to its alert, spirited expression.","Bold and lively, the standard schnauzer is a fun-loving companion and guardian. It is clever and headstrong, and unless given daily physical and mental exercise, it can be mischievous. It does best with a firm, patient owner.

Silky Terrier,"The Silky Terrier is a miniature version of a working terrier, and as such retains the essential features of a vermin hunter. It is somewhat longer than tall, and though of refined bone, it should nonetheless have sufficient strength and substance to suggest that it could kill small rodents. The gait is free and light-footed; the expression is piercingly keen. The straight, single coat is silky and glossy, following the body outline rather than falling to the floor.","The silky terrier is no mellow lap dog.

Spinone Italiano,"The Spinone Italiano has a hound look about it, with a fairly long head and muzzle, large, dropped ears and somewhat pendulous lips. It is a strong, muscular dog, able to trot at fast pace all day and then retrieve over water or land. Its dense wiry coat allows it to hunt under any conditions. The coat is generally single, consisting of rough, dry, thick hair about 1.5 to 2.5 inches in length. Longer hair garnishing the lips and eyebrows adds further protection in addition to adding to its intelligent and gentle expression.","This is a devoted and gentle dog, very willing to please. It is affectionate and gets along well with other dogs and pets and children. It is also courageous.

Schipperke,"The Schipperke is a small, cobby dog, square-proportioned, appearing to slope from shoulders to croup. This appearance is helped by its double coat, which forms a stand-out ruff, cape and culottes. The foxlike face is questioning and mischievous, even impudent. The trot is smooth and graceful. This is an agile, active dog developed as a watchdog and vermin hunter.","The schipperke is a bold companion, even though it can be an independent and headstrong one.

Smooth Fox Terrier,"The Smooth Fox Terrier is square-proportioned, standing over a lot of ground but with a short back. Its conformation combines speed, endurance and power, enabling it to gallop and stay with the horses and hounds during the hunt and to follow a fox up a narrow passage. The gait while trotting gets most of its propulsion from the rear quarters. The expression, like the attitude, is keen; the carriage is alert and expectant. The coat is flat, hard and dense, also with a short, fine undercoat.","The Smooth Fox Terrier is friendly, alert, active, and lively without being high-strung. Through his keen expression and alert bearing, ears up and tail quivering, the Smooth Fox Terrier gives the impression of a dog ready to go anywhere and take on any task.

Saluki,"The Saluki has a general greyhound-like build and should combine grace, symmetry, great speed and endurance. Likwise, it should have the strength to enable it to kill gazelle or other quarry over deep sand or rocky mountains. Its expression should be dignified and gentle, with deep, faithful, far-seeing eyes. Its movement is light. The coat is smooth and silky; the feathered variety has long hair on its ears, tail, between its toes and sometimes on the backs of its legs; the smooth variety has no long feathering. This breed has a wide range of equally acceptable types, reflecting the wide area over which it was developed.","The Saluki tends to be aloof and reserved with strangers. It is extremely devoted to its own family, but it is not particularly demonstrative. The Saluki is very gentle with children, but it may not be playful enough to satisfy most of them. Extremely sensitive, it does not take to rough-and-tumble play or deal well with harsh corrections. Some Salukis can be shy. This breed is very quiet and sedate indoors, seeking out a soft, warm spot. Outside, it runs in great circles at tremendous speeds and will chase any small running animals or fast-moving objects. It may not come when called.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/saluki-2.jpg,Average $2500 - $3000 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Swedish Vallhund,"The low-slung dog may resemble his Corgi cousins, but the Swedish Valhund is a distinct breed that has existed for some thousand years. In his homeland of Sweden, the Vallhund was a valued farm dog used to herd livestock by nipping at their heels. He has many good qualities, including his size and easy-care coat, but he’s not the right breed for everyone.","Friendly and even-tempered Vallhunds are among the world’s most vocal breeds. They’re so chatty that their language of yips, howls, and barks has its own name: “argle bargle.” These smart, energetic dogs do best with owners willing to engage them with work or sports. Vallhunds are zesty companions. “They have a sense of humor and a real joy for life,” says one longtime owner. Loyal and easily trained, both hardworking and fun loving, the Vallhund has it all, except numbers: It’s an exceedingly scarce breed.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/swedish-vallhund-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $2300 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Sealyham Terrier,"The Sealyham Terrier is a short-legged terrier, slightly longer than it is tall. Its body is strong, short-coupled and substantial, allowing for plenty of flexibility. This combination of short legs with a strong and flexible body allows the Sealyham to maneuver in tight quarters. Its weather-resistant coat consists of a soft, dense undercoat and a hard, wiry outer coat. This is a keen, alert and determined breed and should look the part.","One of the calmer terriers, the Sealyham is nonetheless ready for action, always happy to investigate, dig or give chase. It is often aggressive toward other dogs or pets. It is a well-mannered house dog but needs some daily exercise. It is reserved with strangers, but devoted to its family.

Spanish Water Dog,"The Spanish Water Dog is a medium size, athletic, robust dog that is slightly longer than tall. Their tails are usually docked in the US, but undocked tails are not a fault in conformation showing if the dog was bred in a non-docking country. The head should be strong and carried with elegance. The skull is flat and the top is parallel with the top of the muzzle. The nose, eye-rims and paw pads are the same colour as the darkest part of the coat or darker. The eyes are expressive and set fairly wide apart. They should be hazel, chestnut or dark brown in colour, depending on the coat colour. The ears are set at medium height on the skull, and are triangular.","The Spanish Water Dog is diligent, loyal, affectionate, and intelligent. They have very strong natural herding and guarding instincts, leading them to become the ""self-appointed"" guardians of their homes. SWDs thrive on work and play. Their athleticism and extremely hard working nature leads them to excel at any number of tasks. They can be wary with strangers, and early and continuing socialization with a variety of people and other animals is essential for a well-adjusted, social dog. Good socialization at an early age greatly helps them cohabit with small children.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/spanish-water-dog-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $2500 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Scottish Deerhound,"The Scottish Deerhound has a body like that of a greyhound but is of larger size and bone, enabling it to run at great speed using the double-suspension gallop without sacrificing strength and endurance. Its trotting gait is easy and true. Its hair is harsh and crisp, about 3 to 4 inches long on the body, ideally close-lying. Such a coat imparts a weather- (and dirt-) resistant quality, an essential asset in cold, damp climates.","The Scottish deerhound is mellow, low-key and easygoing — a gracious and well-mannered addition to the home. Outdoors, it loves to run and chase anything that moves. Indoors, it needs plenty of room to stretch on a soft surface. The deerhound is independent but willing to please; it is extremely sensitive. It is amiable toward, but often reserved with, strangers. This breed is good with children, other dogs and usually other pets, although it may give chase to strange animals.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/scottish-deerhound-2.jpg,Average $1000 - $2500 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Sussex Spaniel,"The long, low, ""rectangular"" body, coupled with a muscular and rather massive physique, allows the Sussex to penetrate dense cover when hunting. Its movement is deliberate and rolling because of its short legs and comparatively wide body, a gait that emphasizes power over speed. The abundant body coat is flat or slightly wavy, giving protection from thorns. A distinctive feature is the long feather between the toes, which should be long enough to cover the toenails. The expression is somber and serious, even frowning, but the wagging tail belies its true nature. The Sussex tends to bark when hunting, which helps the hunter locate it in thick cover.","The Sussex spaniel tends to be less playful and demonstrative than other spaniels, with a lower energy level. This makes it better suited for city life, but it still appreciates the chance to take to the wilds and hunt up birds. It tends to bark when hunting, which has made it less popular with hunters than other breeds; some also bark or howl when not hunting. At home it is calm, steady and easygoing, although it may be aggressive to strange dogs. Its somber expression is misleading because it is quite cheerful.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/sussex-spaniel-2.jpg,Average $2000 - $3000 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Skye Terrier,"The Skye Terrier is a stylish and elegant dog that is, first of all, a working terrier. It is solidly built, with substantial bone, and twice as long as it is tall. The Skye's short legs enable it to go to ground in pursuit of fox and badger, and the long back imparts flexibility within a confined space. Its strong jaws further aid it in dispatching its prey. Its movement is free and effortless. The hard outer coat and close undercoat afford protection from the teeth of its quarry as well as harsh weather. The outer coat lies straight and flat, 5½ inches or more in length.","The Skye terrier's soft look belies its tough nature. It is a fearless and a deadly rodent hunter. It is also a mild-mannered house pet, one of the few terriers calm enough to live in the city. It still needs daily exercise in a safe area or on leash, however. It is sensitive yet stubborn. The Skye is affectionate with its family but cautious with strangers. It gets along fairly well with other dogs in the same household but may not mingle well with strange dogs. It is extremely courageous and game and makes a good watchdog.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/skye-terrier-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $2000 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Sloughi,"The Sloughi is a medium-large, short-haired, smooth-coated, athletic sighthound developed in North Africa (in the area including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya) to hunt game such as hare, fox, jackal, gazelle, and wild pigs. It is an ancient breed, treasured in North Africa for its hunting skills, speed, agility, and endurance over long distances. It is a robust, but elegant and racy, pursuit dog with no exaggeration of length of body or limbs, muscle development, angulation, nor curve of loin. The Sloughi is not a fragile dog, but is also a dog with class and grace. The attitude is noble and somewhat aloof, and the expression of the dark eyes is gentle and melancholy. The Sloughi's head is long and elegant with drop ears. The body and legs show defined bony structure and strong, lean muscles. The skeletal structure is sturdy. The topline is essentially horizontal blending into a bony, gently sloping croup. The tail is long and carried low with an upward curve at the end.","The Sloughi is an intelligent and very driven hunter which chases on sight what it considers moving prey, but also relies on olfactory and acoustic cues in the chase. In Africa the Sloughi is a working dog, primarily used for hunting. The Sloughi is typically loyal, playful and affectionate with family and cautious and watchful with strangers. The Sloughi does not respond well to harsh training, but benefits from a firm, consistent, fair and praising hand.

The coloration of the dog is large patches of brown on a ticked or solid white background.","Small Münsterländers are extremely intelligent, trainable, and attentive but require gentle and patient training. Coupled with their intelligence, if they determine an owner to be inconsistent or indecisive, the owner might find that the dog will challenge the owner. For training, both voice and hand signals are used, and a Small Münsterländer will routinely look back to check in with the hunter for silent signals at intervals when on hold or pointing. They have a very strong prey drive and enjoy rewarding their owner with productive hunts. They thrive with hunting or comparable challenging exercise for an hour or more every day. They are strong swimmers, especially when compared to other short-haired hunting breeds.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/small-munsterlander-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $1800 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Saarloos wolfdog,"The Saarlooswolfhond has a broad, powerful neck. The moderately broad head is slightly arched between the ears. The erect ears are large like the German Shepherd's. The muzzle has a definite taper to the solid, dark nose. It has long legs with feet that turn slightly outward. The tail is densely feathered and low set. The coat is harsh and not too long with a dense undercoat. Coat colors include agouti, wolf-gray and wolf-brown with limited white markings.","The Saarloosewolfdog is lively, energetic and independent. The breed is devoted and reliable with its master but suspicious of strangers. A natural, wolf-like reserve and desire to flee from unknown situations is typical of this breed.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/saarloos-wolfdog-2.jpg,Average $2000 - $2500 USD,Hypoallergenic: Unknown
Sarplaninac,"The Šarplaninac is a large, strongly built dog. The body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the front legs account for approximately 55% of the height. The head is large but proportional to the body, with dark eyes. All Šarplaninac are solid in colour: fawn, iron grey, white or almost black; usually sable or gray with darker ""overalls"" on the head and back, the undercoat being paler. The colour need not be completely uniform, and most Šarplaninac have several different shades of the same colour fading into one another. There are no bicolours and no uniformly black-coated dogs among purebreds, but odd-coloured specimens do exist. The dogs must not have large white patches in their coat.","The temperament of the breed is described as independent, reliable, protective but not snappy, incorruptible and devoted to its master. The breed is aloof with outsiders, and calm until a threat to the flock presents itself. The breed has an extremely protective nature. In the absence of a flock of sheep, the Šarplaninac will often treat its humans as sheep - herding them away from danger or undesirable areas. They are serene and majestic, gentle with children and smaller dogs. They are also highly intelligent and bred to work without human supervision while guarding the flocks in the high pastures. Young pups can kill small animals until trained not to hunt. Like many of its cousin Mountain dogs, the Šarplaninac is a very serious and dedicated guard dog. Due to this, they are naturally suspicious of strangers and will need good socializing at a young age to lessen this innate personality trait. They are calm and gentle with their family but when faced with danger they become a formidable foe, not a suitable breed for all. Consistent and firm training is essential to ensure compliance.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/sarplaninac-2.jpg,Average $1500 - $2000 USD,Hypoallergenic: Unknown
Schapendoes,"The Schapendoes is a medium sized, lightly built, long coated dog that is equipped with great endurance, mobility and speed. His movement is springy and he is a remarkable jumper. Dense, double and lightly waved. Approximately 3 inches long in the region of the hindquarter. Definitely curly or frizzy hair is unacceptable. The individual hairs are fine and dry, never silky. The coat sometimes stands off in tufts. There is a definite topknot, mustache and beard.","The breed standard describes the Schapendoes as friendly, high spirited, and affectionate. He is not a guard dog or aggressively protective, and if properly socialised while young, would most likely make a good family dog, as well as a good dog for active sports. Lively and intelligent dogs must receive regular training and outings. Temperament of individual dogs may vary. The Schapendoes is furthermore very independent and cooperate with its trainer rather than obey orders.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/schapendoes-2.jpg,Average $1000 - $1500 USD,Hypoallergenic: Unknown
Shikoku dog,"The Shikoku stands 17–21 inches (43–53 cm) high and comes in sesame (red, black), black and tan (nonstandard color), or cream (nonstandard color). These colors consist usually of a light brown, a light red-brown, or a light black-brown. In addition, there is a cream colored coat that tends to be very rare. In all of these colors there is usually a mixture of white found around the underside of the body, near the eyes, snout, and legs. The Shikoku tends to shed its coat at least one to two times a year. The dog has a fairly thick coat with pointed ears and a curved tail. The body conformation is typically of the spitz-type: the square body, the wedge-shaped head, the prick triangular ears, and feathered curled tail.","It is cautious and brave; a temperate dog with good judgment. The Shikoku is also very loyal and submissive to its owner; it loves to be touched and often likes to give kisses. Although, it may be slightly aloof with strangers. This breed needs socialization early to avoid becoming aggressive toward other dogs. Dogs that do become dog aggressive need a competent owner/trainer who knows how to communicate to the dog that this is unacceptable behavior. Shikokus can get along with children if they are raised properly and vice-versa. They have a high prey drive and therefore may not be for everyone; should not be trusted with non-canine pets such as guinea pigs and hamsters.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/shikoku-dog-2.jpg,Average $3000 - $4000 USD,Hypoallergenic: Unknown
Shiloh Shepherd dog,"The Shiloh Shepherd's overall appearance is rather heavy. The back is broad, strong and solid. The head is broad and noble, slightly domed and in proportion to the body.

The muzzle should be predominantly black, the length being equal to that of the forehead, with the lips firmly fitted and solid black. The muzzle should not be long, narrow or snipey in appearance.

The plush coat is medium-length with a dense undercoat and has a distinct mane from the neck to the chest. Hair should not be more than 5"" (12 cm) in length. The smooth coat is thick and medium-length with the outer hair being harsh to the touch.","Bred as companions, Shilohs have loyal and outgoing personalities. Many of the breeders in the United States operate out of large farms where the puppies are introduced to a large variety of animals. They were developed to be gentle and loving, able to work with animals and children, while still possessing a trainable drive for working applications, such as assistive service, obedience, or herding. Shiloh Shepherds are reported to be the least territorial when compared to other Shepherd breeds. With proper socialization they adapt easily to a variety of environments and are stable.

Silken Windhound,"The Silken Windhound is an elegant, small to medium-sized sighthound, with a moderately long, silky coat. Its classic lines and athletic build are the hallmarks of a true coursing dog.

In proportion, they are approximately square or slightly rectangular. Silkens that are excessively longer or shorter than they are tall are to be penalized to the extent of the deviation. The build of the Silken Windhound is sleek, through a balanced combination of fine bladed bone and smooth muscle, and never looks frail.","Silken Windhounds are affectionate and playful and are good dogs for families with children. Owing to their friendliness, they are not good guard dogs but are easily house broken and can be trained to live with smaller household pets. Silkens particularly like agility, therapy, flyball, and obedience. Silken Windhounds are often intelligent and easily trained using reward and affection in short, positive sessions and will work eagerly and form strong relationships with their owners if so treated. Like many sighthounds, Silken Windhounds can slip out of buckle collars, so most owners favour semi-slip collars.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/silken-windhound-2.jpg,Average $2000 - $2500 USD,Hypoallergenic: No
Spanish Mastiff,"The Spanish Mastiff is a very large and powerful dog, similar in appearance to the other Mastiff breeds. They have a large powerful head and serious and vigilant expression.

Reddish tones indicate miscegenation.","This noble giant is aloof, dignified, calm and intelligent. It is devoted to its family and may politely accept strangers if it has been socialized properly, although it will be wary of them. It can be aggressive toward other dogs. The Spanish Mastiff may be a less-than-ideal pet in urban situations, where its booming voice and massive size could be problematic. It is a wonderful protector of its home and family. And an ideal protector of herds and flocks from wolf predation. Socialization and training should begin early to ensure this dog a stable and reliable pet. Supervised exposure in puppy-hood to a variety of unfamiliar but non-threatening dogs will help dampen a tendency to aggression toward other dogs. The breed is quite alert and food motivated but can bore easily; training must be consistent and firm but gentle.

'Dog Breed Info' says the Zuchon is a dog ""known for his endearing face, large expressive eyes, and his soft teddy-bear coat.""

The rough coat can provide extra protection from skin injuries while running in the field. They come in a variety of colors and coat patterns. Main colors are ""barcino"" or ""atigrado"" (brindle), ""negro"" (black), ""barquillo""(golden), ""tostado""(toasted), ""canela"" (cinnamon), ""amarillo""(yellow), ""rojo""(red), ""blanco"" (white), ""berrendo"" (white with patches) or ""pío"" (any colour with white muzzle and forehead).","Galgos have a very similar nature to Greyhounds. They are calm, quiet, gentle and laid back; happy to sleep their day away on their backs on a sofa. More than 90% of Galgos can be considered cat-friendly and are therefore an ideal choice for the hound lover who also owns cats. Almost all Galgos are also friendly towards other dogs and small dogs. Galgos are also very good with children, being calm in the house so there is less risk of a child being knocked over or jumped on than with a more excitable breed. They are very gentle and tolerate the often over-enthusiastic attentions of children with little risk of retaliation from the dog.

Welsh Springer Spaniel,"The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a hunting dog and should be in hard muscular condition. It is in no way a breed of exaggeration. It is very slightly longer than tall, compact and possessing substance without coarseness. Its strides are powerful and ground-covering. The coat is flat and straight, dense enough to protect it from water, weather and thorns but not so excessive as to be a hindrance in the dog's work as a flushing spaniel. The expression is soft.","Less exuberant that the English springer, the Welsh springer spaniel is steady and easygoing. It still needs plenty of hard exercise, however, as it loves to hunt for birds. It is extremely devoted to its family, but it is independent in nature.

The coat is an attractive russet gold. This is a dog of power and drive in the field, yet is a tractable and affectionate companion in the home.

Wetterhoun,"The Wetterhoun is a medium-sized dog between 55 and 59 centimeters (21.5-23 inches) at the withers. They weigh between 25 and 35 kilos (55 and 77 pounds). Their coat is thick and curly except for the head, ears and legs, where the coat is smoother; the water repellant coat is described as having a greasy feel. Coat colour may be solid black or brown, or black with white, or brown with white, with or without white ticking or roan marks. The texture of the coat should not be woolly, as such fur will not resist water. The ears are low set and hang flat to the head, and the tail curls tightly over the back. The breed has an unusual, somewhat grim expression due to the shape of the eyes, which marks it as different from other dog breeds.","This breed is an excellent gun dog, effective as both a land and water retriever, however its strong will and natural guarding abilities make early training a requirement. The breed standard describes the breed's temperament as reserved and ""an ideal guard-dog"". though never aggressive, which makes it an excellent family-dog. Although described as ""strong willed"" the Wetterhoun is never stubborn or wilfully disobedient. Perseverance is a much better term, because they finish what they started, whatever it takes. Imperturbable they finish what they think to be their task. Thereby the breed is sensitive and should never be treated or trained harshly. Brought-up and used to children, they are tolerant to children to the point where the dog should be protected against the children instead the other way around.",https://www.dogbreedslist.info/uploads/dog-pictures/wetterhoun-2.jpg,Average (Unknown),Hypoallergenic: No

The hair is parted on the muzzle and from the base of the skull to the end of the tail. The body is square and evenly proportioned. The dog’s high head carriage and confident manner gives the appearance of vigor and self-importance.","The Yorkshire Terrier is tolerant of older children, provided they respect its personal space. Due to its small size and bold temperament (which arises from its working origins) the Yorkshire Terrier is not recommended for young children unless carefully supervised. The Yorkshire Terrier can occasionally be a bit too brave when dealing with larger dogs, but gets along fine with cats and other household pets.
